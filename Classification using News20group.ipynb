Xt Glossary\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\no The Xt Intrinsics implement an object oriented interface to C code\\n  to allow useful graphical components to be created.  Included with\\n  this are classes that provide the base functionality: Object,\\n  RectObj, Core, Composite, Constraint, Shell, OverrideShell, WMShell,\\n  etc.  The terms \"Xt\" and \"Intrinsics\" are used interchangeably,\\n  however, they are used very precisely to mean a specific library of the X\\n  window system.  In particular, it does not include the Athena,\\n  Motif, OLIT or any other widget set.  Without further widgets the\\n  Intrinsics are not especially useful.\\n\\no A widget refers to a user interface abstraction created via Xt.  The\\n  precise use, is any object that is a subclass of the Core class.  It\\n  is used loosely to refer to anything that is a subclass of the\\n  Object class although these are more accurately called windowless\\n  widgets or gadgets.\\n\\no Xlib is the C interface to the X11 protocol.  It is one layer below\\n  the Xt Intrinsics.  Typically a widget uses relatively few Xlib\\n  functions because Xt provides most such services although an\\n  understanding of Xlib helps with problems.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n1.

Related FAQ\\'s\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nDavid B. Lewis (uunet!craft!faq) maintains the FAQ on X.  It\\nis posted monthly on comp.windows.x and located on export in contrib/FAQ.\\n\\nLiam R. E. Quin (lee@sq.sq.com) posts an FAQ list on Open Look to \\ncomp.windows.x.  \\n\\nJan Newmarch (jan@pandonia.canberra.edu.au) posts an FAQ list on Motif \\nto comp.windows.x.motif.\\n\\nPeter Ware (ware@cis.ohio-state.edu) posts an FAQ list for\\ncomp.windows.x.intrinsics; it is on export in contrib/FAQ-Xt.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n3.  Why does my application core dump when I use signals/alarms/cthreads?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIn brief, Xlib, Xt and most widget sets have no mutual exclusion for\\ncritical sections.  Any interrupt handler is likely to leave one of\\nthe above libraries in an inconsistent state -- such as all the\\nappropriate flags not yet set, dangling pointers, in the middle of a\\nlist traversal, etc.  Note that the ANSI C standard points out that\\nbehavior of a signal handler is undefined if the signal handler calls\\nany function other than signal() itself, so this is not a problem\\nspecific to Xlib and Xt; the POSIX specification mentions other\\nfunctions which may be called safely but it may not be assumed that\\nthese functions are called by Xlib or Xt functions.\\n\\nThe only safe way to deal with signals is to set a flag in the\\ninterrupt handler.  This flag later needs to be checked either by a\\nwork procedure or a timeout callback.  It is incorrect to add either\\nof these in the interrupt handler.  As another note, it is dangerous\\nto add a work procedure that never finishes.  This effectively\\npreempts any work procedures previously added and so they will never\\nbe called.  Another option is to open a pipe, tell the event loop\\nabout the read end using XtAppAddInput() and then the signal handler\\ncan write a byte to the write end of the pipe for each signal.\\nHowever, this could deadlock your process if the pipe fills up.\\n\\nWhy don\\'t the Intrinsics deal with this problem?  Primarily because it\\nis supposed to be a portable layer to any hardware and operating\\nsystem.   Is that a good enough reason -- I don\\'t think so.\\n\\n        Note: the article in The X Journal 1:4 and the example in O\\'Reilly\\nVolume 6 are in error.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n4.  How do I use a different visual than the default?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis requires a more complicated answer than it should.  A window has\\nthree things that are visual specific -- the visual, colormap and\\nborder pixmap.  All widgets have their own Colormap and BorderPixmap\\nresource; only shell widgets have Visual resources (another questions\\ndeals with why shells have a Visual).  The default value of these\\nresources is CopyFromParent which does exactly what it says.  In the\\nshell widget CopyFromParent gets evalulated as DefaultVisualOfScreen\\nand DefaultColormapOfScreen.  When any one of the three resources is\\nnot properly set, a BadMatch error occurs when the window is\\ncreated.  They are not properly set because each of the values depends\\non the visual being used.  \\n\\nHow to get this to work?  There are two parts to the answer.  The\\nfirst is if you want an application to start with a particular visual\\nand the second is if you want a particular shell within an application\\nto start with a different visual.  The second is actually easier\\nbecause the basic information you need is available.  The first is a\\nlittle harder because you\\'ll need to initialize much of the toolkit\\nyourself in order to determine the needed information.\\n\\n/*\\n * Some sample code to start up an application using something other\\n * than the default visual.\\n *\\n * To compile:\\n *\\tcc -g visual.c -o visual -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lXext -lX11 -lm\\n *\\n * To run:\\n *\\t./visual -geometry 300x300 -depth 24 -visual StaticColor -fg blue -bg yellow\\n *\\n * you need to move the mouse to get the particular visuals colormap\\n * to install.\\n */\\n\\n#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\\n#include <X11/StringDefs.h>\\n#include <X11/Shell.h>\\n\\ntypedef struct\\n{\\n\\tVisual\\t*visual;\\n\\tint\\tdepth;\\n} OptionsRec;\\n\\nOptionsRec\\tOptions;\\n\\nXtResource resources[] =\\n{\\n\\t{\"visual\", \"Visual\", XtRVisual, sizeof (Visual *),\\n\\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, visual), XtRImmediate, NULL},\\n\\t{\"depth\", \"Depth\", XtRInt, sizeof (int),\\n\\tXtOffsetOf (OptionsRec, depth), XtRImmediate, NULL},\\n};\\n\\nXrmOptionDescRec Desc[] =\\n{\\n\\t{\"-visual\", \"*visual\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL},\\n\\t{\"-depth\", \"*depth\", XrmoptionSepArg, NULL}\\n};\\n\\n\\n\\nint\\nmain (argc, argv)\\n\\tint\\t\\targc;\\n\\tchar\\t\\t**argv;\\n{\\n\\tXtAppContext\\tapp;\\t\\t/* the application context */\\n\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\t\\t/* toplevel widget */\\n\\tDisplay\\t\\t*dpy;\\t\\t/* display */\\n\\tchar\\t\\t**xargv;\\t/* saved argument vector */\\n\\tint\\t\\txargc;\\t\\t/* saved argument count */\\n\\tColormap\\tcolormap;\\t/* created colormap */\\n\\tXVisualInfo\\tvinfo;\\t\\t/* template for find visual */\\n\\tXVisualInfo\\t*vinfo_list;\\t/* returned list of visuals */\\n\\tint\\t\\tcount;\\t\\t/* number of matchs (only 1?) */\\n\\tArg\\t\\targs[10];\\n\\tCardinal\\tcnt;\\n\\tchar\\t\\t*name = \"test\";\\n\\tchar\\t\\t*class = \"Test\";\\n\\n\\t/*\\n\\t * save the command line arguments\\n\\t */\\n\\n\\txargc = argc;\\n\\txargv = (char **) XtMalloc (argc * sizeof (char *));\\n\\tbcopy ((char *) argv, (char *) xargv, argc * sizeof (char *));\\n\\n\\t/*\\n\\t * The following creates a _dummy_ toplevel widget so we can\\n\\t * retrieve the appropriate visual resource.\\n\\t */\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\ttop = XtAppInitialize (&app, class, Desc, XtNumber (Desc), &argc, argv,\\n\\t\\t\\t       (String *) NULL, args, cnt);\\n\\tdpy = XtDisplay (top);\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\tXtGetApplicationResources (top, &Options, resources,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   XtNumber (resources),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   args, cnt);\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\tif (Options.visual && Options.visual != DefaultVisualOfScreen (XtScreen (top)))\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tXtSetArg (args[cnt], XtNvisual, Options.visual); ++cnt;\\n\\t\\t/*\\n\\t\\t * Now we create an appropriate colormap.

Which visual should an application use?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is a point that can be argued about but one opinion is there is\\nno way for an application to know the appropriate visual -- it has to\\nbe specified by the user.  If you disagree with this then your\\napplication probably falls into the category of always using the\\ndefault visual or it is hardware specific and expects some particular\\nvisual such as 24bit TrueColor with an OverlayPlane extension (or some\\nsuch).\\n\\nWhy?  No application runs in isolation.  Depending on the way a server\\nallocates resources I may not always want your application to run in\\nTrueColor mode if it is going to mess up my other applications.  I may\\nbe very upset if it chooses to run in GreyScale instead of PsuedoColor\\nor just monochrome.\\n\\nAs an example, on a low end color Sun server there are many different\\npossible visuals: monochrome, 256 entry colormap, static gray, static\\ncolor, and a 3/3/2 TrueColor.  The SGI Iris\\'s offer all the above \\nplus 12 bit TrueColor, 24 bit TrueColor, an Overlay Plane.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n6.  Why do only Shell widgets have a Visual?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThis is strictly by convention.  It makes it possible for an arbitrary\\nwidget to know that the visual it uses can be found by looking for the\\nshell widget that is its ancestor and obtaining the visual of that\\nshell.\\n\\nA widget can have its own visual resource.  If it does, it must have\\nits own realize method to use the visual when it calls\\nXCreateWindow().  You should also make this a resource that can be\\nobtained with XtGetValues() so other widgets can find it.  A\\nreasonable value is probably XtNvisual.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n7.  Which visual, depth and colormap do Shells inherit?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe default value for these resources are set to CopyFromParent.  This\\nis interpreted as the DefaultColormapOfScreen(), DefaultDepthOfScreen()\\nand the default visual of the screen if the widget has no parent -- i.e.\\nit is an applicationShellWidgetClass and the root of your widget tree.\\n\\nIf the parent of the widget is not null, then the shell copies\\ncolormap and depth from its parent and uses CopyFromParent as the\\nvisual.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n8.  I\\'ve done all the above and I still get a BadMatch error.  Why?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSome resource converters improperly cache references.  This was\\nespecially true of X11R3 and earlier versions of Motif.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n9.  Why doesn\\'t my widget get destroyed when I call XtDestroyWidget()?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSee section 2.8 of the Xt specification.\\n\\nIt eventually does get destroyed, just not immediately.  The\\nIntrinsics destroy a widget in a two-phase process.  First it and all\\nof its children have a flag set that indicate it is being destroyed.\\nIt is then put on a list of widgets to be destroyed.  This way any\\npending X events or further references to that widget can be cleaned\\nup before the memory is actually freed.  The second phase is then\\nperformed after all callbacks, event handlers, and actions have\\ncompleted, before checking for the next X event.  At this point the\\nlist is traversed and each widget\\'s memory is actually free()\\'d, among\\nother things.\\n\\nAs some further caveats/trivia, the widgets may be destroyed if the\\nIntrinsics determine that they have no further references to the\\nwidgets on the list.  If so, then the phase 2 destruction occurs\\nimmediately.  Also, if nested event loops are used, widgets placed on\\nthe destroy list before entering the inner event loop are not\\ndestroyed until returning to the outer event loop.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n10. How do I exit but still execute the DestroyCallbacks?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe problem is if a simple and entirely reasonable approach to exiting\\nan application is used, such as calling exit() directly, then a widget\\nmay not have a chance to clean up any external state -- such as open\\nsockets, temporary files, allocated X resources, etc.  (this code for\\nsimplicity reasons assumes only a single toplevel widget):\\n\\n\\n\\tWidget\\n\\tToplevelGet (gw)\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget to find toplevel */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\\n\\t\\t\\t/* empty */;\\n\\t\\treturn (top);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tvoid\\n\\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget */\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\t/* data the app specified */\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data;\\t/* widget specific data */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttoplevel;\\n\\n\\t\\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\\n\\t\\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\\t/* make it disappear quickly */\\n\\t\\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\\n\\t\\texit (0);\\n\\t}\\n\\nOne can see that the above code exit\\'s immediately after destroying\\nthe toplevel widget.  The trouble is the phase 2 destruction may never\\noccur.  \\n\\nThis works for most widgets and most applications but will not work\\nfor those widgets that have any external state.  You might think that\\nsince it works now it will always work but remember that part of the\\nreason an object oriented approach is used is so one can be ignorant\\nof the implementation details for each widget.  Which means that the\\nwidget may change and someday require that some external state is\\ncleaned up by the Destroy callbacks.\\n\\nOne alternative is to modify ExitCallback() to set a global flag and\\nthen test for that flag in a private event loop.  However, private\\nevent loops are frowned upon because it tends to encourage sloppy, and\\ndifficult to maintain practices.\\n\\nTry the following code instead.\\n\\n\\t#include <X11/Intrinsic.h>\\n\\n\\textern Widget ToplevelGet (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\textern Boolean ExitWorkProc (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\textern void ExitCallback (\\n\\t#if NeedFunctionPrototypes\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\tgw,\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure,\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data\\n\\t#endif\\n\\t);\\n\\n\\tWidget\\n\\tToplevelGet (gw)\\n\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget to find toplevel */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttop;\\n\\n\\t\\tfor (top = gw; XtParent (top); top = XtParent (top))\\n\\t\\t\\t/* empty */;\\n\\t\\treturn (top);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\n\\tvoid\\n\\tExitCallback (gw, closure, call_data)\\n\\tWidget\\t\\tgw;\\t\\t/* widget */\\n\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\t/* data the app specified */\\n\\tXtPointer\\tcall_data;\\t/* widget specific data */\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tWidget\\t\\ttoplevel;\\n\\n\\t\\ttoplevel = ToplevelGet (gw);\\n\\t\\tXtUnmapWidget (toplevel);\\t/* make it disappear quickly */\\n\\t\\tXtDestroyWidget (toplevel);\\n\\t\\tXtAppAddWorkProc (XtWidgetToApplicationContext (gw),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t  ExitWorkProc, (XtPointer) NULL);\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\tBoolean\\n\\tExitWorkProc (closure)\\n\\t\\tXtPointer\\tclosure;\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\texit (0);\\n\\t\\t/*NOTREACHED*/\\n\\t}\\n\\n\\nExitCallback() adds a work procedure that will get called when the\\napplication is next idle -- which happens after all the events are\\nprocessed and the destroy callbacks are executed.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n11. How do I resize a Shell widget?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nAfter it is realized, one doesn\\'t resize a Shell widget.  The proper\\nthing is to resize the currently managed child of the Shell widget\\nusing XtSetValues().  The geometry change is then propagated to the\\nShell which asks the window manager which may or may not allow the\\nrequest.  However, the Shell must have the resource\\nXtNallowShellResize set to True otherwise it will not even ask the\\nwindow manager to grant the request and the Shell will not resize.\\n\\nTo change the position of a Shell, use XtSetValues() on the Shell, not\\nthe child, and within the limits of the window manager it should be granted.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n12. Why can\\'t XtAppAddInput() handle files?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nIt does, however Unix semantics for when I/O is ready for a file does\\nnot fit most peoples\\' intuitive model.  In Unix terms a file\\ndescriptor is ready for reading whenever the read() call would not\\nblock, ignoring the setting of optional flags that indicate not to\\nblock.  This works as expected for terminals, sockets and pipes.  For\\na file the read() will always return but the return indicates an EOF\\n-- i.e. no more data.  The result is the code in the Intrinsics always\\ncalls the input handler because it always thinks something is about to\\nbe read.  The culprit is the select() system call or on SYSV based\\nOS\\'s it is the poll() system call.\\n\\nHow to get around this on a Unix system?  The best approach is to use\\nanother process to check for available input on the file.  Use a pipe\\nto connect the application with this other process and pass the file\\ndescriptor from the pipe to XtAppAddInput().  A suitable program on\\nBSD systems is \"tail -f filename\".\\n\\nIt\\'s rumored that select() on some systems is not _completely_\\nreliable.  In particular:\\n\\n\\t- IBM AIX 3.1: this is one where it would work for a while\\n\\t  (several thousand times) and then stop until some other\\n\\t  event woke it up. This seemed to be the result of a race\\n\\t  condition in the Kernel.  IBM claims to have a fix for this.\\n\\n\\t- Pyramid, doesn\\'t work at all.\\n\\n\\t- Ultrix (and possibly others where pipes are implemented as\\n\\t  sockets), wasn\\'t completely broken, but although the writing\\n\\t  side wrote in 512 byte blocks the reading side received it\\n\\t  all broken up as if it was being put into the pipe a byte at\\n\\t  a time.  You can waste a lot of time by reading small blocks\\n\\t  (get raound it by detecting the situation and having\\n\\t  select() ignore the pipe for 10 mseconds - by then it had\\n\\t  been given the whole block).\\n\\n\\nNote that all the above descriptions used Unix terminology such as\\nread(), file descriptor, pipes, etc.  This is an OS dependent area and\\nmay not be identical on all systems.  However the Intrinsic designers\\nfelt it was a common enough operation that it should be included with\\npart of the toolkit.  Why they didn\\'t also deal with signals at this\\npoint I don\\'t know.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n13.

What Widgets are available?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThere are three popular widget sets:\\n\\nAthena\\t- The set provided with X11.  This is sufficient for most\\n\\t  purposes but is on the ugly side.  Recently, a 3d look is\\n\\t  available for ftp on export.lcs.mit.edu:/contrib/Xaw3d.tar.Z.\\nMotif\\t- From OSF available for a license fee and commonly shipped on\\n\\t  many workstation vendors platforms (almost everyone but\\n\\t  Sun).  It looks good and works well but personally I think\\n\\t  it is poorly implemented.\\nOLIT\\t- The Open Look Intrinsics Toolkit is a set of widgets\\n\\t  implementing Sun\\'s Open Look specification.  Developed by\\n\\t  AT&T.  I\\'ve never used it so can\\'t comment on its quality.\\n\\t  I\\'ve heard rumours that it is a pain to actually get.\\n\\nIn addition the following collection of widgets are also available:\\n\\nXtra\\t- a library of widgets for sale from Graphical Software\\n\\t  Technology (310-328-9338).  It includes bar graph, stacked\\n\\t  bar graph, line graph, pie chart, xy plot, hypertext, help,\\n\\t  spreadsheet, and data entry form widgets.  I\\'ve never seen\\n\\t  them so I can\\'t comment.\\nFWF\\t- The Free Widget Foundation is attempting to collect a set of\\n\\t  freely available widgets.  Included are a Pixmap editor,\\n\\t  FileDialog, and a few others.  The current set of widgets\\n\\t  can be obtained via anonymous ftp from the machine\\n\\t  a.cs.uiuc.edu (128.174.252.1) in the file pub/fwf.shar.Z.\\nXcu\\t- The Cornell University widgets from Gene Dykes.  One of the\\n\\t  early widget sets released.  Provides a nice appearance for\\n\\t  buttons and has a mini command language.  Probably not so\\n\\t  widely used.\\nXs\\t- The Sony widget set.  This was around during R3 days but\\n\\t  seemed to disappear.  It looked like it had promise.\\nXw\\t- The HP widgets.  The precursor to Motif.  Originally written\\n\\t  for R3 there exists diffs to get it to work under R4 & R5.\\n\\t  Again, a pretty good widget set but has more or less died.\\n\\t  The precursor to this was the Xray toolkit which was\\n\\t  originally implemented for X10R4 and apparently provided\\n\\t  much experience for the designers of Xt.\\nXo\\t- A widget set I\\'m working on.

What alternatives to the Intrinsics are there?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\n\\t__________________________________________\\n\\tName\\t\\tLanguage\\tVendor\\n\\t__________________________________________\\n\\tXview\\t\\tC\\t\\tSun\\n\\tOI\\t\\tC++\\t\\tParcPlace\\n\\tInterviews\\tC++\\t\\tStanford\\n\\tTcl/tk\\t\\tC\\t\\tsprite.berkeley.edu\\n\\t__________________________________________\\n\\n\\nHowever much I like C and admire the skill in both designing and\\nimplementing the Intrinsics, hopefully some alternative will develop\\nin the next 3-5 years that uses an object oriented language.  Keep\\nyour eyes open and expect some change about the same time a language\\nother than C _starts_ gaining acceptance.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n16. How do I pass a float value to XtSetValues?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nFirst, what is going wrong is the structure for an Arg is (essentially)\\n\\ttypdef struct\\n\\t{\\t\\n\\t    String\\tname;\\n\\t    long\\tvalue;\\n\\t} Arg;\\n\\nand the code:\\n\\tArg\\targ;\\n\\n\\tXtSetArg (arg, \"name\", 3.2)\\n\\nexpands to\\n\\tArg\\targ;\\n\\n\\targ.name = \"name\";\\n\\targ.value = 3.2;\\n\\nyou can see that with normal C type conversions, the arg.value\\ngets the integer \"3\" instead of the floating point value \"3.2\".  When\\nthe value is copied into the widget resource, the bit pattern is\\nwildly different than that required for a floating point value.  So,\\nhow to get around this?\\n\\nThe following macro is from the Athena widgets document and I am now\\nrecomending it over the previous suggestions.\\n\\n#define XtSetFloatArg(arg, n, d) \\\\\\n    if (sizeof(float) > sizeof(XtArgVal)) { \\\\\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, &(d)); \\\\\\n    } else { \\\\\\n        XtArgVal *ld = (XtArgVal *)&(d); \\\\\\n        XtSetArg(arg, n, *ld); \\\\\\n    }\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n17. How do I write a resource converter?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nCourtesy of Rich Thomson (rthomson@dsd.es.com):\\n\\nThe following discussion of resource converters assumes R4 (or R5)\\nIntrinsics.  Resource converters changed between R3 and R4 to allow\\nfor destructors and caching of converted values.\\n\\nThere are several main types of resource converters:\\n\\n    string to data type\\n    data type to string\\n    data type to data type\\n\\ni) string to data type\\n    Usually a string to data type converter has a fixed set of strings\\n    that will be converted to data type values.  This is most often\\n    used to map enumerated names to enumerated values:\\n\\n\\tName\\t\\tValue\\n\\t\"True\"\\t\\t1\\n\\t\"False\"\\t\\t0\\n\\n    In this case, the string to data type converter needs to compare\\n    the resource value to the list of fixed strings.  This is most\\n    readily accomplished by the use of the \"quark\" mechanism of the\\n    resource manager.  The resource value is turned into a quark,\\n    which is a unique representation of the string that fits into a\\n    single word.  Then the resource quark is compared against the\\n    quarks for the fixed strings representing the enumerated values.\\n\\n    If there are many enumerated strings in the converter (or many\\n    converters, each with a small number of enumeration strings), then\\n    a global initialization routine might be used to turn all the\\n    resource strings into quarks.  That way, the first time one of\\n    these converters is used, the strings will be turned into quarks\\n    and held in static variables for use in the next invocation of one\\n    of the converters.\\n\\nii) data type to string\\n    This type of converter is slightly easier than the string to data\\n    type converters since the use of quarks isn\\'t necessary.  Instead,\\n    the data type value is simply converted to a string value,\\n    probably by the use of sprintf.\\n\\n    Data type to string converters are useful for applications that\\n    wish to convert an internal data type value into a string so that\\n    they can write out a valid resource specification to a file.  This\\n    mechanism can be used to provide a \"snapshot\" of application state\\n    into a file.  This snapshot can be used to restore the program to\\n    a known state via the usual X resource database mechanisms.\\n\\n    If you are taking the trouble to write a string to data type\\n    converter, it isn\\'t much extra effort to write the data type to\\n    string converter.  Writing both at the same time helps to ensure\\n    that they are consistent.\\n\\niii) data type to data type\\n    This type of converter is used to convert an existing data type\\n    value to another data type.  For instance, an X pixel value can be\\n    converted to an RGB data type that contains separate fields for\\n    red, green and blue.\\n\\n\\nThe type signature for a resource converter is as follows:\\n\\ntypedef Boolean (*XtTypeConverter)(Display *, XrmValuePtr, Cardinal *,\\n\\tXrmValuePtr, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer *);\\n    Display *dpy;\\n    XrmValuePtr args;\\n    Cardinal *num_args;\\n    XrmValuePtr fromVal;\\n    XrmValuePtr toVal;\\n    XtPointer *converter_data;\\n\\nWhen the converter is invoked, the \"fromVal\" argument points to the source\\nX resource manager value and the \"toVal\" argument points to the\\ndestination X resource manager value.  The \"converter_data\" argument\\nis an opaque pointer to some converter-specific data that is specified\\nwhen the converter is registered.  The \"args\" and \"num_args\" arguments\\nallow extra information to be passed to the converter when it is\\ninvoked.  For instance, the Pixel to RGB structure converter discussed\\nabove would need colormap and visual arguments in which to lookup the\\nPixel to obtain the RGB values corresponding to that pixel.\\n\\nCare must be taken with the \"toVal\" argument.  An XrmValue has the\\nfollowing type definition and specifies a size and location for a\\nconverted value:\\n\\ntypedef struct {\\n    unsigned int    size;\\n    caddr_t         addr;\\n} XrmValue, *XrmValuePtr;\\n\\nWhen the converter is invoked, the address may point to a location of\\nthe given size for the converted value or the location can be NULL.\\nIn the former case, the converter should ensure that the size of the\\ndestination area is large enough to handle the converted value.  If\\nthe destination area is not large enough, then the converter should\\nset the size to the amount of space needed and return False.  The\\ncaller can then ensure that enough space is allocated and reinvoke the\\nconverter.  If the size is large enough, then the converter can simply\\ncopy the converted value into the space given and return True.\\n\\nIf the location is NULL, then the converter can assign the location to\\nthe address of a static variable containing the converted value and\\nreturn True.\\n\\nWhen writing a group of converters, this code is often repeated and it\\nbecomes convenient to define a macro:\\n\\n    #define DONE(var, type) \\\\\\n      if (toVal->addr) \\\\\\n\\t{ \\\\\\n\\t  if (toVal->size < sizeof(type)) \\\\\\n\\t    { \\\\\\n\\t      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\\\n\\t      return False; \\\\\\n\\t    } \\\\\\n\\t  else \\\\\\n\\t    *((type *) toVal->addr) = var; \\\\\\n\\t} \\\\\\n      else \\\\\\n\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) &var; \\\\\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(type); \\\\\\n      return True;\\n\\n    #define DONESTR(str) \\\\\\n      if (toVal->addr && toVal->size < sizeof(String)) \\\\\\n\\t{ \\\\\\n\\t  toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\\\n\\t  return False; \\\\\\n\\t} \\\\\\n      else \\\\\\n\\ttoVal->addr = (caddr_t) str; \\\\\\n      toVal->size = sizeof(String); \\\\\\n      return True;\\n\\nInside the converter, it is a good idea to perform a little safety\\nchecking on the \"num_args\" and \"args\" arguments to ensure that your\\nconverter is being called properly.\\n\\nOnce you have written your converter, you need to register it with the\\nIntrinsics.  The Intrinsics invokes resource converters when creating\\nwidgets and fetching their resource values from the resource database.\\n\\nTo register a converter with a single application context, use\\nXtAppSetTypeConverter:\\n\\nvoid XtAppSetTypeConverter(context, from, to, converter, args, num_args,\\n\\tcache, destructor)\\n    XtAppContext context;\\n    String from;\\n    String to;\\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\\n    XtConvertArgList args;\\n    Cardinal num_args;\\n    XtCacheType cache;\\n    XtDestructor destructor;\\n\\nTo register a converter with all application contexts, use\\nXtSetTypeConverter:\\n\\nvoid XtSetTypeConverter(from, to, converter, args, num_args,\\n\\tcache, destructor)\\n    String from;\\n    String to;\\n    XtTypeConverter converter;\\n    XtConvertArgList args;\\n    Cardinal num_args;\\n    XtCacheType cache;\\n    XtDestructor destructor;\\n\\nIn the R3 Intrinsics, there were the routines XtAppAddConverter and\\nXtAddConverter; these have been superseded by XtAppSetTypeConverter\\nand XtSetTypeConverter.  Whenever possible, the newer routines should be\\nused.\\n\\nWhen a converter is registered with the Intrinsics, a \"cache\" argument\\nspecifies how converted resource values are to be cached:\\n\\n    XtCacheNone\\t\\tDon\\'t cache any converted values\\n    XtCacheAll\\t\\tCache all converted values\\n    XtCacheByDisplay\\tCache converted values on a per display basis\\n\\nCaching converted values that require a round-trip to the server is a\\ngood idea (for instance string to Pixel conversions).\\n\\nThe \"destructor\" argument is a routine that is invoked then the\\nresource is destroyed, either because its cached reference count has\\nbeen decremented to zero or because the widget owning the value is\\nbeing destroyed.  XtDestructor has the following type definition:\\n\\ntypedef void (*XtDestructor)(XtAppContext, XrmValuePtr, XtPointer,\\n\\tXrmValuePtr, Cardinal *);\\n    XtAppContext context;\\n    XrmValuePtr to;\\n    XtPointer converter_data;\\n    XrmValuePtr args;\\n    Cardinal *num_args;\\n\\nThe destructor is invoked to free any auxiliary storage associated\\nwith the \"to\" argument, but does not actually free the storage pointed\\nto by the \"to\" argument itself (to->addr).  The destructor is passed\\nthe extra arguments that were passed to the converter when the\\nconversion was performed (for instance, colormap and visual arguments\\nfor the string to Pixel converter since the destructor would need to\\nfree the allocated Pixel from the colormap) as well as the private\\ndata passed in when the converter was registered.\\n\\nSample converter code can be found in the following files in the MIT\\nR5 distribution:\\n\\n    mit/lib/Xt/Converters.c\\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.c\\n    contrib/lib/PEXt/Converters.h\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n18. How do I open multiple displays?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nSee \"Multi-user Application Software Using Xt\", The X Resource, Issue 3,\\n(Summer 1992) by Oliver Jones for a complete coverage of the issues\\ninvolved.  Most of this answer is based on that article.  In a\\nnutshell, one uses XtOpenDisplay() to add each display to a _single_\\napplication context and then XtCloseDisplay() to shutdown each display\\nand remove it from the application context.\\n\\nThe real problems occur when trying to close down a display.  This can\\nhappen 3 ways:\\n\\t1. User selects a \"quit\" button on one of the displays,\\n\\t2. User has window manager send a WM_DELETE_WINDOW message,\\n\\t3. Server disconnect -- possibly from a KillClient message,\\n\\t   server shutdown/crash, or network failure.\\n\\nI\\'ll assume you can deal gracefully with 1 & 2 since it is _merely_ a\\nproblem of translating a Widget to a display and removing that\\ndisplay.  If not, then read the Oliver Jones article.\\n\\nThe third one is difficult to handle.  The following is based on the\\nOliver Jones article and I include it here because it is a difficult\\nproblem.\\n\\nThe difficulty arises because the Xlib design presumed that an I/O\\nerror is always unrecoverable and so fatal.  This is essentially true\\nfor a single display X based application, but not true for a\\nmultiple display program or an application that does things other than\\ndisplay information on an X server.  When an X I/O error occurs the\\nI/O error handler is called and _if_ it returns then an exit()\\nhappens.  The only way around this is to use setjmp/longjmp to avoid\\nreturning to the I/O error handler.  The following code fragment\\ndemonstrates this:\\n\\n#include <setjmp.h>\\njmp_buf XIOrecover;\\n\\nvoid\\nXIOHandler (dpy)\\n\\tDisplay\\t\\t*dpy;\\n{\\n\\tdestroyDisplay (dpy);\\n\\tlongjmp (XIOrecover, 1);\\n}\\n\\nmain ()\\n{\\n\\t...\\n\\tif (setjmp (XIOrecover) == 0)\\n\\t\\tXSetIOErrorHandler (XIOHandler);\\n\\tXtAppMainLoop (app_context);\\n}\\n\\nThe destroyDisplay() is something that given a Display pointer can go\\nback to the application specific data and perform any necessary\\ncleanup.  It should also call XtCloseDisplay().\\n\\nFor those of you unfamiliar with setjmp/longjmp, when setjmp() is\\nfirst called it returns a 0 and save\\'s enough information in the\\njmp_buf that a latter execution of longjmp() can return the program to\\nthe same state as if the setjmp() was just executed.  The return value\\nof this second setjmp() is the value of the second argument to\\nlongjmp().  There are several caveats about using these but for this\\npurpose it is adequate.\\n\\nSome other problems you might run into are resource converters that\\nimproperly cache resources.  The most likely symptoms are Xlib errors\\nsuch as BadColor, BadAtom, or BadFont.  There may be problems with the\\ntotal number of displays you can open since typically only a limited\\nnumber of file descriptors are available with 32 being a typical\\nvalue.  You may also run into authorization problems when trying to\\nconnect to a display.\\n\\nThere was much discussion in comp.windows.x about this topic in\\nNovember of 91.

Where are the resources loaded from?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nThe resources of a widget are filled in from the following places\\n(from highest priority to lowest priority):\\n\\n\\t1. Args passed at creation time.\\n\\t2. Command line arguments.\\n\\t3. User\\'s per host defaults file\\n\\t4. User\\'s defaults file.\\n\\t5. User\\'s per application default file.\\n\\t6. System wide per application default file.\\n\\nNote that 2-6 are read only once on application startup.  The result\\nof steps 3-6 is a single resource database used for further queries.\\n\\nThe per host defaults file contains customizations for all\\napplications executing on a specific computer.  This file is either\\nspecified with the XENVIRONMENT environment variable or if that is not\\nset then the file $HOME/.Xdefaults-<host> is used.\\n\\nThe user defaults file is either obtained from the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\nproperty on the root window of the display or if that is not set then\\nthe file $HOME/.Xdefaults is used.  Typically, the program \"xrdb\" is\\nused to set the RESOURCE_MANAGER property.  Please note that this\\nshould be kept relatively small as each client that connects to the\\ndisplay must transfer the property.  A size of around 1-3KByte is\\nreasonable.  Some toolkits may track changes to the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\nbut most do not.\\n\\nA user may have many per application default files containing\\ncustomizations specific to each application.  The intrinsics are quite\\nflexible on how this file is found.  Read the next part that describes\\nthe various environment variables and how they effect where this file\\nis found.\\n\\nThe system wide per application default files are typically found in\\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults.  If such a file is not found then the\\nfallback resources are used.  The intrinsics are quite flexible on how\\nthis file is found.  Read the next part that describes the various\\nenvironment variables and how they effect where this file is found.\\n\\n[Thanks to Oliver Jones (oj@pictel.com) for the following, 6/92]\\n\\nYou can use several environment variables to control how resources are\\nloaded for your Xt-based programs -- XFILESEARCHPATH,\\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH, and XAPPLRESDIR.  These environment variables\\ncontrol where Xt looks for application-defaults files as an\\napplication is initializing.  Xt loads at most one app-defaults file\\nfrom the path defined in XFILESEARCHPATH and another from the path\\ndefined in XUSERFILESEARCHPATH.\\n\\nSet XFILESEARCHPATH if software is installed on your system in such a\\nway that app-defaults files appear in several different directory\\nhierarchies.  Suppose, for example, that you are running Sun\\'s Open\\nWindows, and you also have some R4 X applications installed in\\n/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults. You could set a value like this for\\nXFILESEARCHPATH, and it would cause Xt to look up app-defaults files\\nin both /usr/lib/X11 and /usr/openwin/lib (or wherever your\\nOPENWINHOME is located):\\n\\n\\tsetenv XFILESEARCHPATH /usr/lib/X11/%T/%N:$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N\\n\\nThe value of this environment variable is a colon-separated list of\\npathnames.  The pathnames contain replacement characters as follows\\n(see XtResolvePathname()):\\n\\n\\t%N\\tThe value of the filename parameter, or the\\n\\t\\tapplication\\'s class name.\\n\\t%T\\tThe value of the file \"type\".  In this case, the\\n\\t\\tliteral string \"app-defaults\"\\n\\t%C\\tcustomization resource (R5 only)\\n\\t%S\\tSuffix.  None for app-defaults.\\n\\t%L\\tLanguage, locale, and codeset (e.g. \"ja_JP.EUC\")\\n\\t%l\\tLanguage part of %L  (e.g. \"ja\")\\n\\t%t\\tThe territory part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\t%c\\tThe codeset part of the display\\'s language string\\n\\nLet\\'s take apart the example.  Suppose the application\\'s class name is\\n\"Myterm\". Also, suppose Open Windows is installed in /usr/openwin.\\n(Notice the example omits locale-specific lookup.)\\n\\n\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N        means /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\t$OPENWINHOME/lib/%T/%N    means /usr/openwin/lib/app-defaults/Myterm\\n\\nAs the application initializes, Xt tries to open both of the above\\napp-defaults files, in the order shown.  As soon as it finds one, it\\nreads it and uses it, and stops looking for others.  The effect of\\nthis path is to search first in /usr/lib/X11, then in /usr/openwin.\\n\\nLet\\'s consider another example. This time, let\\'s set\\nXUSERFILESEARCHPATH so it looks for the file Myterm.ad in the current\\nworking directory, then for Myterm in the directory ~/app-defaults.\\n\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH ./%N.ad:$HOME/app-defaults/%N\\n\\nThe first path in the list expands to ./Myterm.ad.  The second expands\\nto $HOME/app-defaults/Myterm.  This is a convenient setting for\\ndebugging because it follows the Imake convention of naming the\\napp-defaults file Myterm.ad in the application\\'s source directory, so\\nyou can run the application from the directory in which you are\\nworking and still have the resources loaded properly.\\n\\nNOTE: when looking for app-default files with XUSERFILESEARCHPATH,\\n      for some  bizarre reason, neither the type nor file suffix is\\n      defined so %T and %S are useless.\\n\\nWith R5, there\\'s another twist.  You may specify a customization\\nresource value.  For example, you might run the \"myterm\" application\\nlike this:\\n\\n\\tmyterm -xrm \"*customization: -color\"\\n\\nIf one of your pathname specifications had the value\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/%N%C\" then the expanded pathname would be\\n\"/usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/Myterm-color\" because the %C substitution\\ncharacter takes on the value of the customization resource.\\n\\nThe default XFILESEARCHPATH, compiled into Xt, is:\\n\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%L/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%l/%T/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t/usr/lib/X11/%T/%N\\n\\n(Note: some sites replace /usr/lib/X11 with a ProjectRoot in this\\nbatch of default settings.)\\n\\nThe default XUSERFILESEARCHPATH, also compiled into Xt, is \\n\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N%C:\\\\  (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N%C:\\\\     (R5)\\n\\t\\t<root>/%L/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%l/%N:\\\\\\n\\t\\t<root>/%N:\\n\\n<root> is either the value of XAPPLRESDIR or the user\\'s home directory\\nif XAPPLRESDIR is not set.  If you set XUSERFILESEARCHPATH to some\\nvalue other than the default, Xt ignores XAPPLRESDIR altogether.\\n\\nNotice that the quick and dirty way of making your application find\\nyour app-defaults file in your current working directory is to set\\nXAPPLRESDIR to \".\", a single dot.  In R3, all this machinery worked\\ndifferently; for R3 compatibilty, many people set their XAPPLRESDIR\\nvalue to \"./\", a dot followed by a slash.\\n\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n21. What order are callbacks executed in?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/10/92)\\n\\nThe Intrinsics library do not guarantee an order.  This is because\\nboth the widget writer and the application writer have the ability to\\nmodify the entire contents of the callback list.  Neither one\\ncurrently knows what the other is doing and so the Intrinsics cannot\\nguarantee the order of execution.\\n\\nThe application programmer cannot rely on the widget writer; the\\nwidget writer is not required to document when the widget will add and\\nremove callbacks from the list or what effect this will have;\\ntherefore the functionality contained in a callback should be\\nindependent of the functionality contained in other callbacks on the\\nlist.\\n\\nEven though the Xt standard in the definition of XtAddCallback\\nsays:\\n\\n \\t\"callback_name: Specifies the callback list to which the\\n \\tprocedure is to be appended.\"\\n \\nyou may not infer from the word \"appended\" that the callback routines\\nare called in the same order as they have been added to the callback\\nlist.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n22. How do I know if a widget is visible?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Donna Converse, converse@expo.lcs.mit.edu; 5/14/92)\\n\\n> I am building a widget needs to know if it is visible. I set the visible\\n> interest field in Core and if my window is completely obscured, the Core\\n> visible flag goes FALSE. However, if my window is iconified, the flag\\n> stays set to TRUE.\\n\\nRight, everything is implemented correctly.  This demonstrates a \"deficiency\"\\nin the X protocol, and the Core widget is reflecting the capabilities of the\\nprotocol.  (The \"deficiency\" is that the information is available in one way,\\nin this case an inconvenient way.)  The Xt specification is accurate, in\\nthe second and third paragraphs of section 7.10.2, so read this section\\ncarefully.  The visible field will not change in response to iconification.\\n\\nA VisibilityNotify event will not be received when the window goes from\\nviewable to unviewable, that is, when the widget or an ancestor is unmapped;\\nthat is, when iconification occurs.  This is the protocol deficiency.\\nVisibility state and viewable state have specific meanings in the X protocol;\\nsee the glossary in your Xlib and X protocol reference manual.\\n\\n> Is this a problem with \"mwm\" or is there something\\n> else which needs to be done?\\n\\nYou\\'ll see this with any window manager, with no window manager.\\n\\n> If the problem is \"mwm\", what is the fastest\\n> way to determine if a window is iconified? \\n\\nAs an application writer, keep track with a global Boolean in an action\\nroutine with translations for MapNotify and UnmapNotify on the Shell widget\\nwhich contains your custom widget.  As the custom widget writer, see the\\nmap_state field returned by a call to XGetWindowAttributes.  These are\\nsuggestions.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n23. How do I reparent a widget in Xt, i.e. XtReparentWidget()?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nYou can\\'t.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n24. Why use XtMalloc, XtFree, etc?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n\\nUnfortunately, most code that calls malloc(), realloc() or calloc()\\ntends to ignore the possibility of returning NULL.  At best it is\\nhandled something like:\\n\\n\\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type))\\n\\tif (!ptr)\\n\\t{\\n\\t\\tperror (\"malloc in xyzzy()\");\\n\\t\\texit (1)\\n\\t}\\nTo handle this common case the Intrinsics define the functions\\nXtMalloc(), XtCalloc(), XtNew(), XtNewString() and XtRealloc() which\\nall use the standard C language functions malloc(), calloc() and\\nrealloc() but execute XtErrorMsg() if a NULL value is returned.  Xt\\nerror handlers are not supposed to return so this effectively exits.\\n\\nIn addition, if XtRealloc() is called with a NULL pointer, it uses\\nXtMalloc() to get the initial space.  This allows code like:\\n\\n\\tif (!ptr)\\n\\t\\tptr = (type *) malloc (sizeof (type));\\n\\telse\\n\\t\\tptr = (type *) realloc (ptr, sizeof (type) * (count + 1));\\n\\t++count;\\n\\nto be written as:\\n\\n\\tptr = XtRealloc (ptr, sizeof (ptr) * ++count);\\n\\nAlso, XtFree() accepts a NULL pointer as an argument.  Generally, I\\'ve\\nfound the Xt functions conveniant to use.  However, anytime I\\'m\\nallocating anything potentially large I use the standard functions so\\nI can fully recover from not enough memory errors.\\n\\nXtNew() and XtNewString() are conveniant macros for allocating a\\nstructure or copying a string:\\n\\n\\t  struct abc *xyzzy;\\n\\t  char\\t     *ptr;\\n\\t  char\\t     *str = \"abcdef\";\\n\\n\\t  xyzzy = XtNew (struct abc);\\t/* takes care of type casting */\\n\\t  ptr = XtNewString (str);\\n\\nA strict interpretation of the Intrinsics reference manual allow an\\nimplementation to provide functions that are not exchangable with\\nmalloc() and free().  I.e. code such as:\\n\\n\\t char\\t      *ptr;\\n\\n\\t ptr = XtMalloc (100);\\n\\t /* ... */\\n\\t free (ptr);\\n\\nmay not work.  Personally, I\\'d call any implementation that did this\\nbroken and complain to the vendor.\\n\\nA common error for Motif programmers is to use XtFree() on a string\\nwhen they should really be using XmStringFree().\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n25. How to debug an Xt application?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\nFirst, I\\'d recomend getting \"purify\" from Pure Software.  This is a\\ngreat package for tracing memory problems on Sun\\'s.  It\\'s a bit pricey\\nat $2750 but I\\'d still recomend it.  Excuse the marketing blurb\\n(contact support@pure.com for more info).\\n\\n\\tPurify inserts additional checking instructions directly into\\n\\tthe object code produced by existing compilers.  These\\n\\tinstructions check every memory read and write performed by\\n\\tthe program under test and detect several types of access\\n\\terrors, such as reading unitialized memory, writing past\\n\\tmalloc\\'d bounds, or writing to freed memory.  Purify inserts\\n\\tchecking logic into all of the code in a program, including\\n\\tthird party and vendor object-code libraries, and verifies\\n\\tsystem call interfaces.  In addition, Purify tracks memory\\n\\tusage and identifies individual memory leaks using a novel\\n\\tadaption of garbage collection techniques.  Purify\\'s nearly\\n\\tcomprehensive memory access checking slows the target program\\n\\tdown typically by a factor of two to five.\\n\\nAn alternative package that isn\\'t as pricey ($395 for a Sun), runs on\\nmany Unix\\'s and has pretty similar features is \"The SENTINEL Debugging\\nEnvironment\".  This replaces malloc() and several other C library\\nfunctions to add additional checks.  (contact cpcahil@virtech.vti.com\\nfor more info)\\n\\nNext, if you are getting any sort of Xlib error, you\\'ll need to run in\\nsynchronous mode, easily accomplished with the \"-sync\" command line\\nargument or by setting the variable Xdebug to 1 with your debugger.  Then\\nset a break point in exit().  This will let you trace back to the\\noriginal Xlib function being called.  If you don\\'t run in synchronous\\nmode, then the actual error may have occured any number of calls to\\nXlib previously since the Xlib calls are buffered and replies from the\\nserver are asynchronous.\\n\\nNext, if you are having trouble with window layout, you can use the\\nundocumented resource \"xtIdentifyWindows\" or the class resource\\n\"XtDebug\" to cause the widget name to be identified with each window.\\nFor example:\\n\\n    example% xload -xrm \\'*XtDebug:true\\' &\\n    example% xwininfo -tree\\n\\t     <click in new xload window>\\n\\nwill give the normal information but the widget name and class of each\\nwindow is included.  This can help for checking the location and size\\nof errant widgets.\\n\\nNext, if you are having trouble with geometry managers or you want to\\ntest the way a widget manages it\\'s children, you can try\\nexport.lcs.mit.edu:contrib/libXtGeo.tar.Z.  This acts as a filter\\nbetween any children and a geometry manager and checks the behaviour\\nof both.  It\\'s a very clever idea.\\n\\nThe most unfortunate problem is debugging a callback while the\\napplication is executing a grab of the keyboard or mouse (such as from\\na pulldown menu).  The server effectively locks up and you\\'ll need to\\ngo to another machine and kill the debugger manually.  The server\\nlocks up because the application being debugged has said no one else\\ncan have access to the keyboard but the application is not stopped\\nwaiting because the debugger is waiting for your commands.\\nUnfortunately you can\\'t give them because all the input is going to\\nyour application which is stopped.\\n\\nThe best way to debug this kind of problem is with two machines on\\nyour desk, running the program under a debugger (or other environment)\\non one machine, and running the application on the other, possibly\\nusing a command sequence like this:\\n\\n\\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\\n\\tthismachine% setenv DISPLAY othermachine:0;\\n\\tthismachine% gdb application\\t# Your favorite debugger.\\n\\tor this:\\n\\tothermachine% xhost +thismachine\\n\\tthismachine% gdb application\\n\\t(gdb) set environment DISPLAY othermachine:0\\n\\t(gdb) run ...\\n\\nI believe CodeCenter, a C interpreter/graphical debugger has a method\\nof dealing with this by explicitely calling the Xlib functions to\\nrelease any grabs during breakpoints.\\n\\nDebugging widget problems requires pretty good debugging skills and\\nknowledge of how widgets work.  You can go a long way without knowing\\nthe internals of a particular widget but not very far without\\nunderstanding how a widget works.  Judicious use of conditional\\nbreakpoints and adding print statements with the debugger help a great\\ndeal.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n26. Why don\\'t XtAddInput(), XtAddTimeout() and XtAddWorkProc() work?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n   I have got a delicate problem with the three routines XtAddInput,\\n   XtAddTimeOut and XtAddWorkProc. The problem I have is that when\\n   I use them in my application they seem not to be registred properly.\\n   I have made a handy little testprogram where everything works\\n   perfect, but in my \"real\" application nothing happens. \\n\\nThe introduction in R3 of the XtApp*() functions obsoleted those\\nroutines (see Q19 for other changes in R3, R4, and R5).  What happens is\\nthey use a default application context different then the one you may\\nhave created.  Since events and timeouts are distributed on a per\\napplication context basis and you are using two application contexts,\\nyou won\\'t get those events.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\\t...\\n\\tcnt = 0;\\n\\ttoplevel = XtAppInitialize(&app, class,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   Desc, XtNumber (Desc),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   &argc, argv,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t   Fallback, args, cnt);\\n\\n\\tXtAddTimeOut (...)\\n\\tXtAddWorkProc (...)\\n\\n\\tXtAppMainLoop (app)\\n\\nwould never invoke the timeout.\\n\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n27. What is and how can I implement drag and drop?\\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\\n(Courtesy of Roger Reynolds, rogerr@netcom.com; 19 Feb 93)\\n\\nDrag-n-drop is a buzzword for moving data between clients, in an\\n``intuitive\\'\\' fashion.\\n\\nMotif Version 1.2 supports drag-n-drop capabilities, OpenLook has\\nsupported d-n-d all along.  The two protocols are not compatable with\\neach other, and so far as I know, they are not published.\\n\\nI wrote a package called RDD which is designed to be a flexible public\\nprotocol for doing drag \\'n drop operations between clients.  My\\nintention was to provide a tool which would make it easy for people to\\nsupport a \"standard\" drag-n-drop protocol in the programs they develop\\nand contribute or sell, regardless of what widget set is used (as long\\nas it is based on Xt).\\n\\nThe implementation is based upon my understanding of the ICCCM\\nconventions, for more details read the code.\\n\\nI have heard from dozens of people using RDD who like it and feel that\\nit works a whole lot better than Motif 1.2 stuff.  Also, there seem to\\nbe many who think that it is neat but are constrained to use Motif\\nanyway.\\n\\nThe latest RDD (and some other stuff) is available for ftp from\\nnetcom.com, in /pub/rogerr.

Value == accuracy comes from out of left field.  \\n\\nI can only understand that by \\'\"useful in making some conclusion\" is an accuracy\\njudgement\\' you mean one can judge whether it is *really* useful in making\\nthat conclusion or not.   That\\'s part of what I mean by objective\\nvaluation - values grounded in solid facts.  One doesn\\'t value x for the \\npurpose y if all the evidence suggests that x doesn\\'t really do that. The\\nrest of what I mean is that the really fundamental values (e.g.  our own \\nfreedom) are solid facts in themselves.\\n\\nConsider each of the following statements:\\n\\n(1) The only reason that the distinction between \\'accurate\\' and \\n\\'inaccurate\\' exists at all is that a group of people finds it useful.  \\n\\n(2) The main reason that science exists at all is that a group of people\\nfinds the distinction between \\'accurate\\' and \\'inaccurate\\' useful in\\ndealing with phenomena.\\n\\n(3) Scientists find simple theories with accurate predictions useful in\\nmodelling phenomena.\\n\\nWhere is the \\'pun\\' of which you speak?  Where am I arguing from idiom?  \\nAnd what is wrong, if those statements are true, with concluding that \"the \\nbasis of science is its *judged* usefulness in dealing with phenomena, i.e. \\n\\'subjective\\' values\"?    After all, what on earth is (3), if not a \\n\\'subjective\\' value judgement?  (an \\'accurate\\' value judgement, maybe?)\\n\\nJust to illustrate what I mean: what\\'s the difference between saying\\n\\'simple theories with accurate predictions are the best tools we have\\nto model phenomena\\' and (say) \\'Love and intelligence are the best tools we have\\nto achieve freedom\\'?  Is one \\'objective\\', the other not?  Both are \\njudgements about value (\"best\"), and both have the same empirical basis, from \\nwhere _I_ sit.\\n\\n#Sorry, Frank, but all you\\'re doing is\\n#using the ambiguity of English to obfuscate the issue. IF you\\n#mean to say that science is based on value (accuracy) judgements,\\n#I have no problem with that. If you mean to say that it\\'s based\\n#on value (goodness) judgements, that\\'s nonsense. By contrast,\\n#morality is clearly based on goodness judgements.\\n\\nI\\'m afraid I do mean to say that it\\'s based on \"goodness\" judgements.\\n\"Simple theories with accurate predictions are better (_better_, BETTER) \\ntools for interpreting reality than complex theories with inaccurate \\npredictions\" is a fundamental value judgement that scientists make.  A \\nrelativist might say that it only holds in the reference frame of \"science\", \\nor of a given scientist - but it seems pretty solid and objective to me.\\n\\n-- \\nFrank O\\'Dwyer                                  \\'I\\'m not hatching That\\'\\nodwyer@sse.ie                                  from \"Hens\",  by Evelyn Conlon\\n',\n",
              "       b'\\nHi... I\\'m not a religious guy so dont take this as some kinda flame (thanx\\nin advance)\\n\\nI want to know why there are so many different versions of the bible? There\\nis this version of the bible I have read about and on the front page it says:\\n\"....contains inaccurate data and inconsistencies.\"   \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThanx in advance... Shaz....\\n\\n[I\\'m not sure quite what you mean by many different versions.\\nThe primary distinction in versions you see today is in the style\\nof the translation.  It\\'s pretty unusual to see significant\\ndifferences in meaning.  There are a few differences in the underlying\\ntext.  That\\'s because before printing, manuscripts were copied by\\nhand.  Slight differences resulted.  There are enough manuscripts\\naround that scholars can do a pretty good job of recreating the\\noriginal, but there are some uncertainties.  Fortunately, they are\\ngenerally at the level of minor differences in wording.  There are\\nsomething like 3 or 4 places where whole sentences are involved,\\nbut with recent discoveries of older manuscripts, I don\\'t think there\\'s\\nmuch uncertainly about those cases.  As far as I know, no Christians\\nbelieve that the process of copying manuscripts or the process of\\ntranslating is free of error.  But I also don\\'t think there\\'s\\nenough uncertainty in establishing the text or translating it that\\nit has much practical effect.\\n\\nWhether the Bible contains inaccurate data and inconsistences is a hot\\ntopic of debate here.  Many Christians deny it.  Some accept it\\n(though most would say that the inaccuracies involved are on details\\nthat don\\'t affect the faith).  But this has nothing to do with there\\nbeing multiple versions.  The supposed inconsistences can be found in\\nall the versions.  I\\'m surprised to find a reference to this on the\\ntitle page though.  What version are you talking about?  I\\'ve been\\nreferring to major scholarly translations.  These are what get\\nreferenced in postings here and elsewhere.  There have certainly been\\neditions that are (to be kind) less widely accepted.  This includes\\neverything from reconstructions that combine parallel accounts into\\nsingle narrations, to editions that omit material that the editor\\nobjects to for some reason or the other.  The copyright on the Bible\\nhas long since expired, so there nothing to stop people from making\\neditions that do whatever wierd thing they want.  However the editions\\nthat are widely used are carefully prepared by groups of scholars from\\na variety of backgrounds, with lots of crosschecks.  I could imagine\\none of the lesser-known editions claiming to have fixed up all\\ninaccurate data and inconsistencies.  But if so, it\\'s not any edition\\nthat\\'s widely used.  The widely used ones leave the text as is.\\n(Weeeeelllllll, almost as is.  It\\'s been alleged that a few\\ntranslations have fudged a word or two here and there to minimize\\ninconsistencies.  Because translation is not an exact science, there\\nare always going to be differences in opinion over which word is best,\\nI\\'m afraid.)\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

If anything, one could claim that,\\nin a sense, Daniel is a descendant of Zoroaster; as Daniel, though being\\nHebrew, has assimilated into Zoroastrianism and has successfully\\nintroduced the religion into the Tanakh of Judaism. [However, the majority \\nof the book is in Hellenistic Aramaic (not Babylonian Aramaic) and only has\\nKethuvim or Writing status.]\\n\\nRef: Encyclopedia of Religion, Mircea Eliade:\\n\\nDANIEL, or, in Hebrew, Daniyye\\'l; hero of the biblical book that bears his name.\\nDaniel is presented as a Jew in the Babylonian exile who achieved notoriety in\\nthe royal court for his dream interpretations and cryptography and for his\\nsalvation from death in a lion\\'s pit. He also appears in the last chapters of\\nthe book as the revealer of divine mysteries and of the timetables of Israel\\'s\\nrestoration to national-religious autonomy. As a practitioner of oneiromancy in\\nthe court, described in Daniel 1-6 (written in the third person), Daniel per-\\nforms his interpretations alone, while as a visionary-apocalyptist, in Daniel\\n7-12 (written in the first person), he is in need of an angel to help him\\ndecode his visions and mysteries of the future. It is likely that the name\\nDaniel is pseudonymous, a deliberate allusion to a wise and righteous man known\\nfrom Ugaritic legend and earlier biblical tradition. (Ez. 14:4,28:3).\\n  The authorship of the book is complicated not only by the diverse narrative\\nvoices and content but by its language: Daniel 1:1-2:4a and 8-12 are written in\\nHebrew, whereas Daniel 2:4b-7:28 is in Aramaic. The language division parallels\\nthe subject division (Daniel 1-6 concerns legends and dream interpretations;\\n7-12 concerns apocalyptic visions and interpretations of older prophecies). The\\noverall chronological scheme as well as internal thematic balances (Daniel 2-7\\nis chiliastically related) suggest an attempt at redactional unity. After the\\nprefatory tale emphasizing the life in court and the loyalty of Daniel and some\\nyouths to their ancestral religion, a chronological ordering is discernable: a\\nsequence from King Nebuchadrezzar to Darius is reported (Dn. 7-12). Much of\\nthis royal dating and even some of the tales are problematic: for example,\\nDaniel 4 speaks of Nebuchadrezzar\\'s transformation into a beast, a story that\\nis reported in the Qumran scrolls of Nabonidus; Belshazzar is portrayed as the\\nlast king of Babylon, although he was never king; and Darius is called a Mede\\nwho conquered Babylon and is placed before Cyrus II of Persia, although no such\\nDarius is known (the Medes followed the Persians, and Darius is the name of\\nseveral Persian kings). Presumably the episodes of Daniel 2-6, depicting a\\nseries of monarchical reversals, episodes of ritual observances, and reports of\\nmiraculous deliverances were collected in the Seleucid period (late fourth to\\nmid-second century BCE) in order to reinvigorate waning Jewish hopes in divine\\nprovidence and encourage steadfast faith.\\n  The visions of Daniel 7-12, reporting events from the reign of Belshazzar to\\nthat of Cyrus II (but actually predicting the overthrow of Seleucid rule in\\nPalestine), were collected and published during the reign of Antiochus IV prior\\nto the Maccabean Revolt, for it was then (beginning in 168 BCE) that the Jews\\nwere put to the test concerning their allegiance to Judaism and their ancestral\\ntraditions, and many refused to desecrate the statues of Moses and endured a\\nmartyr\\'s death for their resolute trust in divine dominion. All of the visions\\nof Daniel dramatize this dominion in different ways: for example, via images of\\nthe enthronement of a God of judgment, with a \"son of man\" invested with rule\\n(this figure was interpreted by Jews as Michael the archangel and by Christians\\nas Christ), in chapter 7; via zodiacal images of cosmic beasts with bizarre\\nmanifestations, as in chapter 8; or via complex reinterpretations of ancient\\nprophecies, especially those of Jeremiah 25:9-11, as found in Daniel 9-12.\\n  The imagery of the four beasts in chapter 7 (paralleled by the image of four\\nmetals in chapter 2), representing four kingdoms to be overthrown by a fifth\\nmonarchy of divine origin, is one of the enduring images of the book; it sur-\\nvived as a prototype of Jewish and Christian historical and apocalyptic schemes\\nto the end of the Middle Ages. The role and power of this imagery in the\\nfifteenth and sixteenth century work of the exegete Isaac Abravanel, the\\nscientist Isaac Newton, and the philosopher Jean Bodin and among the Fifth\\nMonarchy Men of seventeenth century England, for example, is abiding testimony\\nto the use of this ancient topos in organizing the chiliastic imagination of\\ndiverse thinkers and groups. The schema is still used to this day by various\\ngroups predicting the apocalyptic advent.\\n  The encouragement in the face of religious persecution that is found and\\npropagandized in Daniel 11-12 contains a remarkable reinterpretation of Isaiah\\n52:13-53:12, regarding the suffering servant of God not as all Israel but as\\nthe select faithful. Neither the opening stories about Daniel and the youths nor\\nthe final martyrological allusions advocate violence or revolt; they rather\\nadvocate a stance of piety, civil disobedience, and trustful resignation.\\nVictory for the faithful is in the hands of the archangel Michael, and the\\nmartyrs will be resurrected and granted astral immortality. Persumably the\\ncircles behind the book were not the same as the Maccabean fighters and may\\nreflect some proto-Pharisaic group of hasidim, or pietists. The themes of\\nresistance to oppression, freedom of worship, preservation of monotheistic\\nintegrity, the overthrow of historical dominions, and the acknowledgement of\\nthe God of heaven recur throughout the book and have served as a token of\\ntrust for the faithful in their darkest hour.\\n\\nZARATHUSHTRA, founder of the religion know as Zoroastrianism or Mazdaism (from\\nMazda or Ahura Mazda, the name of the god prophesied by Zarathushtra.) The\\netymology and history of Zarathushtra, the Avestan and oldest form of the name,\\nas uncertain, both in various Iranian languages and in related forms else-\\nwhere. There may have been an Old Persian form, Zara-ushtra, from which the\\nGreek form, Zoroastres, may be derived, and there may have existed an Old\\nIranian form, Zarat-ushtra, to which may be linked the Middle Iranian Zrdrwsht,\\nseveral Middle Persian forms (such as Zrtwsht), and the New Persian Zardusht.\\nWe can state with certainty only that the second half of the name, ushtra,\\nmeans \"camel.\" The form Zoroaster, derived from the Greek Zoroastres, was used\\ntraditionally in European culture until the eighteenth century, when\\nZarathustra, closer to the original (and as found in Nietzsche), came into\\ncommon use after the rediscovery of the Avesta, the collection of sacred books\\nof Zoroastrianism, and the resulting studies in Iranian philology. [See Avesta.]\\n  Notwithstanding the great and continued popularity of Zarathushtra, even in\\nWestern culture, the sources available to us are few, extremely fragmented,\\nand heterogeneous. Our principle sources are the five Gathas (\"songs\"),\\nattributed to Zarathushtra himself and included in the Yasna section of the\\nAvesta: Gatha Ahunavaiti (Yasna 28-34), Gatha Ushtavaiti (Yasna 43-46), Gatha\\nSpentamainyu (Yasna 47-50), Gatha Vokukhshathra (Yasna 51), and Gatha\\nVashishtoishti (Yasna 53), the last of which was probably written after the\\nprophet\\'s death.\\n  Other sources of considerable, albeit varying, importance are the Younger\\nAvesta and the remaining Zoroastrian religious literature, in particular the\\nPahlavi texts of the ninth and tenth centures CE. Although the Achaemenid\\ninscriptions (sixth to fourth centures BCE) never mention Zarathushtra, he is\\nmentioned by some Greek sources of the time (not, however, by Herodotus, who\\nseems unaware of him).\\n  The Avesta does not provide any direct or explicit data concerning the true\\nchronological history of Zarathushtra. But the text is useful in an indirect\\nway, as it clearly implies that the environment in which Zoroastrianism arose\\nwas not that of Iran under the Medes or the Persians. The Greek sources, on the\\nother hand, do provide some information concerning the time of Zarathushtra,\\nalthough from a historical point of view they are unreliable. Some place him\\nsix thousand years before the Trojan War (Xanthus of Lydia, Eudoxus of Cnidus,\\nHermippus, Hermodorus, Aristotle, Plutarch, Diogenes Laertius, and Pliny). The\\naccount by Xanthus of Lydia, however, has also been interpreted by some to mean\\nsix hundred, rather than six thousand, years before the expedition of Xerxes\\nagainst Greece. This interpretation is favored by Diogenes Laertius, who makes\\nreference to Xanthus, but although a few scholars (A. S. Shabazi, Helmut\\nHumbach) have recently attempted to rehabilitate it under various pretexts, it\\nis generally rejected.\\n  Although the historical value of the Greek sources is negligible, they are\\nnonetheless important in that they show that the millenarian doctrine of history\\nof the cosmos had already been developed in Iran by the Achaemenid period, as\\nthe above account would seem to demonstrate. They also show that by this time\\nZarathushtra was already seen as an almost mythical figure, one from an\\nextremely distant past. All of this leads to the conclusion that the prophet\\ncould not have belonged to a historical period contemporary with, or even close\\nto, that of the Achaemenids.\\n  Later Zoroastrian sources, the Pahlavi texts, do provide an absolute chrono-\\nlogy for Zarathushtra, one that was also accepted by some Arab authors. Accord-\\ning to these sources, Zarathushtra lived 300 or 258 years before Alexander.\\nAgain, scholars are divided on the validity of the chronology; some view it as\\nhistorically reliable while others believe that it is devoid of historical\\njustification. The most convincing arguments, however, seem to support the\\nlatter position. The figure of 258 years is accurate only on the surface\\nbecause it represents, in fact, the more general one of 300, which was employed\\nby Sasanid propagandists to locate Zarathushtra\\'s lifetime roughly around the\\nbeginning of Iranian domination. For a number of reasons connected with complex\\nproblems inherent in the Iranian chronology, there was also a desire on the\\npart of the Sasanid propagandists to avoid any millenarian threat. In this\\ncontext, Zarathushtra, whom tradition places early in the ninth millennium after\\nthe beginning of the cosmos, converted Vishtaspa at the age of forty-two, and\\nVishtaspa\\'s conversion was viewed by some as the beginning of the millennium\\n(thus explaining the double date of 300 and 258 years before Alexander).\\n  Given the unreliability of the few available sources, we are forced to\\nreconstruct an absolute chronology on the basis of other elements, principally\\non the contention that Zarathushtra must have lived a few centuries before Cyrus\\nthe Great, Cambyses, and Darius, as there is no mention in the Avesta of the\\ngreat political achievements that took place in western Iran in the middle of\\nthe first millennium BCE. Nor is there any mention of the history of that\\nperiod, which was to lead Iran to a position of such predominance. At the same\\ntime, for a number of reasons, going back much further in history would not be\\njustified. Consequently, the traditionally accepted theory of placing Zara-\\nthushtra around the beginning of the first millennium BCE appears to be the\\nmost legitimate.\\n  As to Zarathushtra\\'s land of origin, many scholars agree, on the basis of\\nvalid arguments, that he must have come from eastern Iran. Some have held that\\nhe was a Mede, largely because of a late Iranian tradition linking Zarathushtra\\nwith Azerbaijan, but also because of linguistic reasons, based on the language\\nof the Avesta. This hypothesis, however, should be discarded, as we can suppose,\\nboth on historical and linguistic grounds, that Zarathushtra came from the east,\\neven though we do not know precisely from which region. There is a considerable\\nvariety of opinion on this particular matter, including the improbable view\\nthat he came from Chorasmia, or present-day Khorezm, or from a wider Chorasmian\\nregion, reaching as far as the oases of Merv and Herat. Most likely, however,\\nZarathushtra\\'s land of origin is somewhere in the vast area stretching from the\\nHindu Kush mountain range to the more southern regions of Bactria and Arachosia\\n(modern Qandahar), as well as Drangiana (the area of lake Helmand). It would\\nthus be located in what is now Afghanistan or in the border regions of Iran.\\n  Zarathushtra himself tells us that he belonged to the priestly caste (Yasna\\n33.6). He was a zaotar (cf. Sanskrit hotr), that is, a priest belonging to a\\nspecific group connected with a school that produced very elaborate and learned\\nreligious poetry. Even in the so-called Younger Avesta he is described as an\\nathravan (Yashts 13.94), a more general term encompassing the entire priestly\\ncaste. To enter it he had undergone a long and rigid training, which he used\\nto lend dignity (as in the Gathas) to the contents of his new message, the\\nproduct of a great and original ethical mind.\\n  Zarathushtra also belongs to that venerable priestly tradition, linking India\\nto Iran in another way, by centering his teachings on the praise of the ashavan,\\nor \"possessor of asha,\" that is, the one who, as in the Vedic rtavan, seeks\\ntruth and masters it, thus becoming ashavan in this life - almost an initiate -\\nand blessed after death. Any good follower of such teachings seeks the \"vision\\nof asha,\" just as those chosing the right path in Vedic India aspired to the\\n\"vision of the Sun,\" a manifestation of rta. Behind these concepts and this\\nlanguage lies the great tradition of \"Aryan mysticism,\" that is, of Indo-Iranian\\nmysticism.\\n  Zarathushtra\\'s greatness, however, does not lie in his having belonged to a\\nparticular religious tradition. Rather, it lies in the innovation and strength\\nof his message, which was in itself a break in the tradition, one that force-\\nfully and effectively introduced two great revolutionary ideas: dualistic\\nmonotheism (the Wise Lord who fathers two twin spirits, the beneficent and the\\nevil); and the expectation of a transfiguration (Av., Frashokereti; Pahl.,\\nFrashgird) of life and existence. [See Frashokereti] \\n  Both his monotheistic and dualistic ideas and his particular soteriological\\ndoctrine deeply separate Zarathushtra\\'s teachings from the Indo-Iranian tradi-\\ntions of his upbringing. They exemplify his rebellion against a formalistic\\nand ritualistic religion that did not provide adequate answers to the problem\\nof evil. Because of his basic tenets, Zarathushtra, who advocated an inward\\nreligiosity and the right of the individual to resist the imperatives of tradi-\\ntion, can be numbered among the greatest of religious figures.\\n  Another original facet of Zarathushtra\\'s message, one that is not easy to\\nunderstand but which, however, holds the key to a deeper understanding of the\\ncomplex intellectual and poetic structure of the Gathas, is the doctrine of the\\nAmesha Spentas, the \"beneficent immortals.\" These are spiritualizations of the\\nabstract notions of good thought, best truth, desirable power, bounteous\\ndevotion, wholeness, and immortality, all of which operate according to a\\nsystem of interrelations and correlations and can simultaneously be the\\nmanifestations of a divinity and of human virtue. [See Amesha Spentas.]\\n  Other than the names of his father, Pourushaspa (\"possessing gray horses\"),\\nand of his mother, Dughdova (\"one who has milked\"), we know almost nothing of\\nZarathushtra\\'s life. A late Pahlavi text also give the names of four brothers.\\nAccording to tradition, Zarathushtra left home at the age of twenty, and at\\nthirty he was subject to a revelation, both through an intense and powerful\\ninspiration and through a vision. Only after ten years had passed, however, did\\nhe succeed in converting a cousin of his, Maidhyoimah, to his beliefs. He was\\nstrongly opposed in his native land by kavis, karapans, and usijs, priestly\\ngroups associated with traditional teachings and practices. This hostility\\ncaused him to leave his region (Yasna 46:1) and to seek refuge at the court of\\nKavi Vishtaspa, a ruler who had been converted to the new religion together with\\nhis wife, Hutaosa, when the prophet, according to tradition, was forty-two\\nyears old. We also know the name of a son, Isat Vastra (\"desiring pastures\"),\\nand of three daughters born of his first wife, as well as the names of two more\\nsons, Urvatatnara (\"commanding men\") and Hvarecithra (\"sun-faced\"), born of\\nhis second wife, Hvovi, a member of the influential Hvogva (\"possessing good\\ncattle\") family. Two other figures belonging to the Hvogva family are mentioned:\\nFrashaoshtra and Jamaspa, the former as Hvovi\\'s father, and the latter as the\\nhusband of the third daughter of the prophet, Pouruchista (\"very thoughtful\"),\\nwhose wedding is celebrated in the fifth hymm in the Gathas (Yasna 53). Again,\\naccording to tradition, Zarathushtra died at the age of seventy-seven. He was\\nassassinated by a karapan, a priest of the old religion, who belonged to the\\nTuirya tribe and was called Tur i Bradres (his name is known only in the Pahlavi\\nform).\\n  The paucity of information on the prophet\\'s life is compensated by a tradi-\\ntion, rich in legendary detail, that arose through the centuries in Zoroastrian\\ncommunities. The main texts documenting the tradition are the seventh book of\\nthe Denkard, a Pahlavi work dating from the ninth century CE, as well as\\npassages from other Pahlavi texts and a New Persian work from the thirteenth\\ncentury, the Zarathusht-nama (Book of Zarathushtra), written by Zaratusht-i\\nBahram-i Pazhdu. Mythical and ritual elements prevail in the later legends about\\nZarathushtra, which idealize him into a symbol and make him the archetype of the\\nperfect man.\\n  Zarathushtra\\'s great popularity in the ancient world continued throughout the\\nRenaissance until the Enlightenment. During the Classical and Hellenistic\\nperiods he was viewed as a wise man, a typical representative of an \"alien\\nwisdom,\" a master of the secrets of heaven and earth, a seer, astrologer,\\npsychologist, and wonder worker. Pythagorean thinkers went so far as to see the\\ninfluence of Zarathushtra on Pythagoras himself, and the Academicians always\\nopenly admired the Persian thinker who founded the school of the Magi and\\nadvocated a doctrine of dualism. Earliest Christianity viewed Zarathushtra as\\na precursor of the Christian faith, one who not only prophesied, as had the\\nbiblical prophets, the advent of the Messiah but also predicted the supernatural\\nsign of his coming, the star that was to appear in the East and guide the three\\nMagi to the manger in Bethlehem. [See Magi.] This Christian interpretation is\\nderived from the Zoroastrian doctrine of the Saoshyant, the Savior of the\\nFuture. [See Saoshyant.] Later, however, religious struggles arose during the\\nSasanid empire in Persia (third to seventh centuries CE), which linked the\\nspread of Christianity with the Roman empire. Zarathushtra\\'s popularity in the\\nChristian world began to decline. The Iranian prophet, who had been praised\\noften by the gnostic schools and who had been seen by Mani as one of the three\\ngreat messengers from the past, was now seen, instead, as a leader of imposture\\nand heresy, a teacher of the diabolic arts of witchery. But during the Renaiss-\\nance and the Enlightenment, European cultures reverted to the image of Zara-\\nthushtra that had come down through Classical and Hellenistic antiquity. He was\\nviewed, once again, as a great and wise man, as the author of the _Chaldean\\nOracles_ and probably inventor of Qabbalah, as a teacher of astrology, as a\\npossible bridge between Christianity and Platonism, and, at times (as in\\nVoltaire), as a symbol of non-Christian wisdom.\\n  After Western philology rediscovered Zarathushtra during the eighteenth and\\nnineteenth centuries, Friedrich Nietzsche, in an intentional paradox, gave\\nthe name Zarathustra to the hero of his work _Also sprach Zarathustra_ (1883-\\n1892). Nietzsche saw the Iranian prophet as the first to have discovered the\\ntrue motive force underlying all things, that is, the eternal struggle between\\ngood and evil.

              "       b\"Here is a press release from the White House.\\n\\n President Clinton's Remarks On Waco With Q/A\\n To: National Desk\\n Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100\\n\\n   WASHINGTON, April 20 -- Following are remarks by President \\nClinton in a question and answer session with the press:\\n\\n1:36 P.M. EDT\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  On February the 28th, four federal\\nagents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law\\nagainst the Branch Davidian compound, which had illegally stockpiled\\nweaponry and ammunition, and placed innocent children at risk.\\nBecause the BATF operation had failed to meet its objective, a 51-day\\nstandoff ensued.\\n\\n     The Federal Bureau of Investigation then made every\\nreasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without\\nbloodshed and further loss of life.  The Bureau's efforts were\\nultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were\\ndealing, David Koresh, was dangerous, irrational, and probably\\ninsane.\\n\\n     He engaged in numerous activities which violated both\\nfederal law and common standards of decency.  He was, moreover,\\nresponsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the\\naction against the compound in February.  Given his inclination\\ntowards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages, no\\nprovocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal\\nagents against the compound.\\n\\n     This weekend I was briefed by Attorney General Reno on\\nan operation prepared by the FBI, designed to increase pressure on\\nKoresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully.\\nThe plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition, even\\nin the face of fire, and instead to use tear gas that would not cause\\npermanent harm to health, but would, it was hoped, force the people\\nin the compound to come outside and to surrender.\\n\\n     I was informed of the plan to end the siege.  I\\ndiscussed it with Attorney General Reno.  I asked the questions I\\nthought it was appropriate for me to ask.  I then told her to do what\\nshe thought was right, and I take full responsibility for the\\nimplementation of the decision.\\n\\n     Yesterday's action ended in a horrible human tragedy.\\nMr. Koresh's response to the demands for his surrender by federal\\nagents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his\\ncaptives, as well as all the other people who were there who did not\\nsurvive.  He killed those he controlled, and he bears ultimate\\nresponsibility for the carnage that ensued.\\n\\n     Now we must review the past with an eye towards the\\nfuture.  I have directed the United Stated Departments of Justice and\\nTreasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to\\nuncover what happened and why, and whether anything could have been\\ndne differently.  I have told the departments to involve independent\\nprofessional law enforcement officials in the investigation.  I\\nexpect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required\\nto complete the review.  Finally, I have directed the departments to\\ncooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can\\ncontinue to be fully accountable to the American people.\\n\\n     I want to express my appreciation to the Attorney\\nGeneral, to the Justice Department, and to the federal agents on the\\nfront lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult\\ncircumstances.\\n\\n     Again, I want to say as I did yesterday, I am very sorry\\nfor the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end\\nof this tragedy in Waco.  I hope very much that others who will be\\ntempted to join cults and to become involved with people like David\\nKoresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over\\nthe last seven weeks.  And I hope very much that the difficult\\nsituations which federal agents confronted there and which they will\\nbe doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future\\nwill be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what\\nhas been learned now.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you, first of all, tell us why,\\nafter 51 days, you decided --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, can you describe for us what it is\\nthat Janet Reno outlined to you in your 15-minute phone conversation\\nwith --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I can't hear you both.  If one will go\\nfirst and then the other.\\n\\n     Q  Sorry.  Can you describe what Janet Reno --\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  I'll answer both your questions, but I\\ncan't do it at once.\\n\\n     Q  Can you describe what she told you on Sunday about\\nthe nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Yes.  I was told by the Attorney General\\nthat the FBI strongly felt that the time had come to take another\\nstep in trying to dislodge the people in the compound.  And she\\ndescribed generally what the operation would be -- that they wanted\\nto go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause\\npermanent damage to adults or to children, but which would make it\\nvery difficult for people to stay inside the building.  And it was\\nhoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside.\\n\\n     I was further told that under no circumstances would our\\npeople fire any shots at them even if fired upon.  They were going to\\nshoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and\\nthere would be no exchange of fire.  In fact, as you know, an awful\\nlot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials.\\nThere were no shots coming back from the government side.\\n\\n     I asked a number of questions.  The first question I\\nasked is, why now?  We have waited seven weeks; why now?  The reasons\\nI was given were the following:\\n\\n     Number one, that there was a limit to how long the\\nfederal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the\\nquality and intensity of coverage by experts there.  They might be\\nneeded in other parts of the country.\\n\\n     Number two, that the people who had reviewed this had\\nnever seen a case quite like this one before, and they were convinced\\nthat no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to\\nbe made through the normal means of getting Koresh and the other cult\\nmembers to come out.\\n\\n     Number three, that the danger of their doing something\\nto themselves or to others was likely to increase, not decrease, with\\nthe passage of time.\\n\\n     And number four, that they had reason to believe that\\nthe children who were still inside the compound were being abused\\nsignificantly, as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and\\nunsafe conditions.\\n\\n     So for those reasons, they wanted to move at that time.\\nThe second question I asked the Attorney General is whether they had\\ngiven consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and\\nevaluated them against what might happen that was good.  She said\\nthat the FBI personnel on the scene and those working with them were\\nconvinced that the chances of bad things happening would only\\nincrease with the passage of time.\\n\\n     The third question I asked was, has the military been\\nconsulted?  As soon as the initial tragedy came to light in Waco,\\nthat's the first thing I asked to be done, because it was obvious\\nthat this was not a typical law enforcement situation.  Military\\npeople were then brought in, helped to analyze the situation and some\\nof the problems that were presented by it.   And so I asked if the\\nmilitary had been consulted.  The Attorney General said that they\\nhad, and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one\\nminor tactical difference of opinion between the FBI and the military\\n-- something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming\\nsignificance.\\n\\n     Having asked those questions and gotten those answers, I\\nsaid that if she thought it was the right thing to do, that she\\nshould proceed and that I would support it.  And I stand by that\\ntoday.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President --\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Wait.  Go ahead.\\n\\n     Q  Can you address the widespread perception --\\nreported widely, television, radio and newspapers -- that you were\\ntrying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No, I'm bewildered by it.  The only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday -- let me say -- the only\\nreason I made no public statement yesterday is that I had nothing to\\nadd to what was being said and I literally did not know until rather\\nlate in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who\\nhad been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into\\ncustody.  It was purely and simply a question of waiting for events\\nto unfold.\\n\\n     There was -- I have -- I can't account for why people\\nspeculated one way or the other, but I talked to the Attorney General\\non the day before the action took place.  I talked to her yesterday.\\nI called her again late last night after she appeared on the Larry\\nKing Show, and I talked to her again this morning.  A President -- it\\nis not possible for a President to distance himself from things that\\nhappen when the federal government is in control.\\n\\n     I will say this, however.  I was, frankly, surprised\\nwould be a mild word, to say that anyone that would suggest that the\\nAttorney General should resign because some religious fanatics\\nmurdered themselves.  (Applause.)\\n\\n     I regret what happened, but it is not possible in this\\nlife to control the behavior of others in every circumstance.  These\\npeople killed four federal officials in the line of duty.  They were\\nheavily armed.  They fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly,\\nand they were never fired back on.  We did everything we could to\\navoid the loss of life.  They made the decision to immolate\\nthemselves.  And I regret it terribly, and I feel awful about the\\nchildren.\\n\\n     But in the end, the last comment I had from Janet Reno,\\nis when -- and I talked to her on Sunday -- I said, now, I want you\\nto tell me once more why you believe -- not why they believe -- why\\nyou believe we should move now rather than wait some more.  And she\\nsaid, it's because of the children.  They have evidence that those\\nchildren are still being abused and that they're in increasingly\\nunsafe conditions, and that they don't think it will get any easier\\nwith time -- with the passage of time.  I have to take their word for\\nthat.  So that is where I think things stand.\\n\\n     Q  Can we assume then that you don't think this was\\nmishandled in view of the outcome, that you didn't run out of\\npatience?  And if you had it to do over again, would you really\\ndecide that way?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  No -- well, I think what you can assume\\nis just exactly what I announced today.  This is a -- the FBI has\\ndone a lot of things right for this country over a long period of\\ntime.  This is the same FBI that found the people that bombed the\\nWorld Trade Center in lickety-split, record time.  We want an inquiry\\nto analyze the steps along the way.  Is there something else we\\nshould have known?  Is there some other question they should have\\nasked?  Is there some other question I should have asked?  Can I say\\nfor sure that no one -- that we could have done nothing else to make\\nthe outcome come different?  I don't know that.  That's why I want\\nthe inquiry and that's why I would like to make sure that we have\\nsome independent law enforcement people, not political people, but\\ntotally non-political, outside experts who can bring to bear the best\\nevidence we have.\\n\\n     There is, unfortunately, a rise in this sort of\\nfanaticism all across the world.  And we may have to confront it\\nagain.  And I want to know whether there is anything we can do,\\nparticularly when there are children involved.  But I do think it is\\nimportant to recognize that the wrong-doers in this case were the\\npeople who killed others and then killed themselves.\\n\\n     Q  Mr. President, were there any other options\\npresented to you for resolving this situation at any point from\\nFebruary 28th until yesterday?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, yes, I got regular reports all\\nalong the way.  There were lots of other options pursued.  If you go\\nback -- you all covered it very well.  The FBI -- you did a very good\\njob of it.  I mean, the FBI and the other authorities there pursued\\nany number of other options all along the way, and a lot of them\\nearly on seemed to be working.  Some of the children got out, some of\\nthe other people left.  There was a -- at one point, there seemed to\\nbe some lines of communication opening up between Koresh and the\\nauthorities.  And then he would say things and not do them and things\\njust began to spin downward.\\n\\n     Whether there were other -- in terms of what happened\\nyesterday, the conversation I had with the Attorney General did not\\ninvolve other options except whether we should take more time with\\nthe present strategy we were pursuing -- because they said they\\nwanted to do this, because they thought this was the best way to get\\npeople out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves.\\nThat's what they thought.\\n\\n     Q  Did the government know that the children did not\\nhave gas masks?\\n\\n     Q     congressional hearings once the situation -- are\\nyou in agreement with that?\\n\\n     THE PRESIDENT:  That's up to the Congress.  They can do\\nwhatever they want.  But I think it's very important that the\\nTreasury and Justice Departments launch this investigation and bring\\nin some outside experts.  And as I said in my statement, if any\\ncongressional committees want to look into it, we will fully\\ncooperate.  There is nothing to hide here.  This was probably the\\nmost well-covered operation of its kind in the history of the\\ncountry.\\n\\n   (more, more)\\n -30-\\n\",\n",

These lines were taken as \\n strong evidence for neutron stars being the objects responsible for \\n GRBs since the magnetic field indicated was 1.0E12, fairly typical \\n for a neutron star.

However, if they are in the halo, in order \\n that they appear isotropic, the \"core radius\" of the halo (i.e. the \\n innermost region of the halo) has to be greater than about 50 kpc.\\n The halo itself would stretch much further than this.  Since the \\n Andromeda Galaxy is only 700 kpc away, we should be seeing bursts\\n from that galaxy\\'s halo, which we aren\\'t.\\n\\njs> If the bursts are something like the cosmic black body radiation from\\njs> way back then where are the red shifts - I mean cosmological red shifts?\\n\\n Remember to get a redshift, one needs some type of emission or \\n absorption line so one can compare the observed line frequency \\n to the rest line frequency.

              "       b\"\\nI am having trouble with SCSI on a Mac IIfx. The machine is 3 years old\\nand I have been using the same hard drive (internal Maxtor LXT-200S) for\\ntwo and a half years. The disk recently crashed. I reformatted (Silverlining\\n5.42), but during the reformat I received random write errors during testing.\\nThe error message reported was like:\\n\\nSector 0: Write error detected after testing good - sector not mapped out.\\n\\nThis occurred randomly all over the hard disk (which makes me suspect the\\ndiagnostic's reference to Sector 0 ??? ). On the third reformat and after\\nreinstalling the SCSI read/write loops I was able to get through passes\\n2,3, and 4 with no errors. (Pass 1 for some reason reported a lot of errors,\\nbut still mapped out no sectors.) I decided to go ahead and try to resinstall\\nSystem 7 and reload my data from a backup. This proceded normally; however,\\nI now have sub-optimal performance. Symptoms include:\\n\\n   o Frequent crashes\\n   o Instances of extremely sluggish disk access requiring a reboot to\\n       correct.\\n   o Instances of not finding the disk on the SCSI chain on reboot.\\n       - If I boot from Norton Utl. after this occurs, it cannot find the\\n         disk either.\\n       - The only thing that fixes this is recycling the power. It sometimes\\n         requires several attempts.\\n\\nQUESTIONS:\\n\\n   1) Has anyone had this type of problem before?\\n   2) Is the problem with the fx motherboard (And its non-standard\\n      SCSI implementation) or with my Maxtor Disk? Is there some\\n      diagnostic software that would help me make this determination?\\n   3) Is it a termination problem? I currently have external Syquest\\n      and an external DataFrame XP60 on the chain. The XP60 is at the\\n      end, and has internal termination; so I am not using the IIfx\\n      terminator. I do have the SCSI filter installed on the internal\\n      drive. I have run with this exact steup for 2 1/2 years with\\n      one previous disk crash requiring a reformat (about a year ago).\\n      I also have symptoms if I disconnect the external devices;\\n      so I don't see how SCSI termination would now be an issue.

              "       b'Approved: christian@aramis.rutgers.edu\\n\\nMeta-exegesis: Conviction of Sin,  part II\\n\\nLet me return to the question, stipulating that Paul meant his use of\\n_arseonkoitai_ to refer more or less exactly to the Levitical prohibition\\nof male-male sex.  In order to bring out the problems most clearly, I\\'ll\\nalso stipulate (what I think is far less plausible) that Paul coined the\\nterm for this usage.  The question I want to turn to is what that would\\nmean for Paul\\'s readers and for later Christians.  This should be shorter\\nthan my last note, as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us\\nwith some of the major divisions within Christ\\'s body, and I am not trying\\nto open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that\\nseparate any of us from our fellow Christians.  My own biases (loosely\\ncharacterizable as \"liberal\") will be evident, but I am not grinding an\\naxe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD\\nto reach \"closure\" when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we\\neach, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ.\\n\\nSo; stipulating Paul\\'s intent, the immediate question is: HOW CAN HIS\\nREADERS UNDERSTAND this intent?  And following on that question, there is\\na second one: WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him?\\n\\nSince Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st\\nCorinthians, there are two \"positive\" answers and one \"negative\" to this\\nquestion:\\n\\n+\\ta.  Paul (or Apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has\\n\\t    conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem-\\n\\t    nation of homosexual behavior, and Paul expects them to be\\n\\t    sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no\\n\\t    futher explanation.  [I should note that there is no evidence\\n\\t    in the letter, or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition :-)]\\n\\n+\\tb.  The Spirit will teach us what Paul means (or, if not Paul,\\n\\t    what God means \"behind\" Paul\\'s inspired word-choice.)\\n\\n-\\tc.  We *don\\'t* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre-\\n\\t    cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by Paul,\\n\\t    in the same passage of the word  _pleonektai_ (\"those who have\\n\\t    more\" -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is \"obvious\" from\\n\\t    its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word!  The NEB\\n\\t    translates it as \"grabbers\") or even _methusoi_ (\"drunkards\"\\n\\t    -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult,\\n\\t    so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!)\\n\\nThe three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggeration\\nfor the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towards\\ntradition, one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/critical\\ndemand for evidence.  All three positions have strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n_ad_ a:\\tIt is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the\\n\\tcommunity of Christ\\'s disciples and their successors, and that\\n\\tour NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition.\\n\\tBut it\\'s also the case that we know little or nothing about this\\n\\ttradition until almost a century after Paul, which is to say that\\n\\twe have access to the tradition only after several generations of\\n\\tpossibly confused transmission.  The scripture is itself our only\\n\\tdocumentation of the tradition in the critical era.\\n\\n_ad_ b:\\tIf we are NOT born of water and Spirit [to revert to John in an\\n\\tattempt to explain Paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under-\\n\\tstanding the gospel than Nicodemus had; neither the traditions of\\n\\tmen nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit\\n\\tfrom blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze.  But\\n\\tthe downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit\\n\\tas our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that\\n\\ttakes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent\\n\\tunderstanding supposedly derived from the \"clear\" Word of God.\\n\\n\\t\\t[Note: classical Lutheran, Calvinist and Anglican thought\\n\\t\\tconstrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, even\\n\\t\\twhile reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture;\\n\\t\\tthe more bizarre forms of \"I will read Scripture my way\"\\n\\t\\tare primarily a fringe aspect of \"cultic\" Protestantism.]\\n\\n\\tThe main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no\\n\\tmeans for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel\\n\\t*is* teaching received from the Spirit; and history shows incredible\\n\\tconflict between Christians on this point, each in his own mind\\n\\t\"convinced\" that he is led by the Spirit.  No one can seriously\\n\\turge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian\\n\\tagainst Christian.  To what purpose?\\n\\n_ad_ c:\\tThe critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can\\n\\treach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is open\\n\\tto all.  The weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usually\\n\\tpossible. :-)\\n\\n\\t[If I may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias;\\n\\tone complaint against critical methodology is that it \"dissolves\"\\n\\tfaith -- but surely a \"faith\" that cannot honestly face the evalu-\\n\\tation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to\\n\\taddress.]\\n\\nAnyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between\\n\"liberal\" and \"conservative\" positions, mostly on the basis of extreme\\nzealots of positions b and c.  A Catholic sense of authority and tradition\\ntends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so that\\ndespite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as\\nultimately divisive as the Protestant world will.  And Anglicans will (I\\npredict) muddle through on the _via media_, attempting to give each position\\nits due, but no more than its due. \\n\\nSecond question.  Suppose tradition tells us, and lots of \"spiritual\"\\nChristians tell us, and critical thought at least admits as possible,\\nthat Paul is refering to a flat, universal Levitical prohibition against\\nmale-male sex.  What then?  Again, we can abdicate our personal responsi-\\nbility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer.  But it\\'s precisely\\nwhere inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they\\'re most dangerous.\\n\\nWe have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of\\ntradition (despite his urging, in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them).\\nWe have EXAMPLES of Peter, and more radically still Paul, jettisoning the\\ntraditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question.  Jesus\\nand Peter and Paul do not so much \"throw out\" tradition as subject it to\\nradical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds:\\n\\n     \"the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Matthew 23:23)\\nand  \"On these two commandments [love God & neighbor] hand the whole Law,\\n      and the Prophets, also.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Matthew 22:40)\\n\\nIf there is a fundamental (because derived from Christ) validity in the\\nchallenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generation\\nto go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts\\n(vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus\\' reported\\nwords and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination\\nto *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges\\nagainst are in fact open to challenge.\\n\\nAll traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men.  That God may\\nlead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritual\\ninstruction I will freely grant.  But tradition is inherently human, and\\ninherently corruptible (and given the Fall, corrupt).  Nothing in it is\\nimmune to challenge, when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercy\\nand good faith.  Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow from\\nlove of God and love of neighbor.\\n\\nI am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin.  That\\nthe Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me (or I am\\ntoo dense to learn).  That tradition *might* have value here.  But what I\\n*know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious Christians\\nappealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor, and scapegoated\\n\"sodomites\" as the \"cause\" of the earthquake, so that legislation was\\npassed making homosexual behavior a capital offense.  If that is in\\naccord with the gospel of Christ, then I am no Christian.  That is human\\ntradition at its most hateful and vicious.  And I see nothing all that much\\ndifferent in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quick\\nto condemn but slow to understand.  If that is the leading of the Spirit,\\nthen I want no part of it.  But what I have found in obedience to the Lord\\nis that I am, myself, TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians,\\nfor the truth that lives in the Body of Christ.\\n\\nAnd I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamaliel\\nsaid to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church:\\n\\n\\t\"be careful how you deal with these people...  If this enterprise,\\n\\tthis movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up of\\n\\tits own accord; but if it does in fact come from God you will not\\n\\tonly be unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselves\\n\\tfighting against God.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Acts 5:36...39] \\n\\nAll I ask is that you listen to your traditions, and read your scriptures\\nwith a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit, and to the past history of our\\nfirst Christian witnesses\\' willingness to challenge tradition and OTHER\\nreadings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes and\\nrabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the\\nlove of God and neighbor.  Then, study the evidence; learn the history of\\nChristians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness to\\njudge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge.  And let the witness of\\nthe Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians -- including those who\\nare NOT of your preference in theology -- guide you towards God\\'s truth.\\n-- \\nMichael L. Siemon\\t\\tI say \"You are gods, sons of the\\nmls@panix.com\\t\\t\\tMost High, all of you; nevertheless\\n    - or -\\t\\t\\tyou shall die like men, and fall\\nmls@ulysses.att..com\\t\\tlike any prince.\"   Psalm 82:6-7\\n\\n[There\\'s a certain ambiguity in your discussion of position (a), as to\\nwhether you\\'re speaking of tradition in Paul\\'s time or ours.  I think\\nthere are two ways to use tradition.  One is to say that when Paul and\\nhis readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his words\\nin the context of that shared tradition.  That\\'s what makes me think\\nthat these arguments over words turn out to be silly.  We know that\\nPaul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex.\\nEverything else he says on sex is consistent with that background.\\nThe tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent with\\nthat background.  Even if the words in the sin lists aren\\'t the most\\ngeneral terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there\\'s\\nsome evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece of\\nevidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no\\nevidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nBut when you identify (a) with the Catholic position, that\\'s rather a\\nhorse of a different color.  The Catholic position involves a\\ncontinuing church tradition.  Arguments specific to that tradition\\nmight be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul\\'s original\\nmeaning from tradition, e.g. the way the Church Fathers interpreted\\nhim, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in\\nour time because of the universal judgement of the church between his\\ntime and ours.  I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition.\\nA radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent.\\ntradition to illuminate Paul\\'s original meaning, but not use the\\nCatholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to\\nhomosexuality should be.\\n\\n--clh]\\n',\n",

How do I become an astronaut?\\n\\n    A. We will assume you mean a NASA astronaut, since it\\'s probably\\n    impossible for a non-Russian to get into the cosmonaut corps (paying\\n    passengers are not professional cosmonauts), and the other nations have\\n    so few astronauts (and fly even fewer) that you\\'re better off hoping to\\n    win a lottery. Becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast-jet\\n    experience, which means a military flying career; forget that unless you\\n    want to do it anyway. So you want to become a shuttle \"mission\\n    specialist\".\\n\\n    If you aren\\'t a US citizen, become one; that is a must.  After that,\\n    the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly\\n    exceeds the supply.  NASA\\'s problem is not finding qualified people,\\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\\tIt is not enough\\n    to be qualified; you must avoid being *dis*qualified for any reason,\\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\\n\\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in something that involves getting your hands\\n    dirty with equipment, not just paper and pencil.  Forget computer\\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\\n    seeable future.  Degree(s) in one field plus work experience in\\n    another seems to be a frequent winner.\\n\\n    Be in good physical condition, with good eyesight.\\t(DO NOT get a\\n    radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision; nobody knows\\n    what sudden pressure changes would do to RKed eyes, and long-term\\n    effects are poorly understood.  For that matter, avoid any other\\n    significant medical unknowns.)  If you can pass a jet-pilot physical,\\n    you should be okay; if you can\\'t, your chances are poor.\\n\\n    Practise public speaking, and be conservative and conformist in\\n    appearance and actions; you\\'ve got a tough selling job ahead, trying\\n    to convince a cautious, conservative selection committee that you\\n    are better than hundreds of other applicants.  (And, also, that you\\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relations is\\n    a significant part of the job, and NASA\\'s image is very prim and\\n    proper.)  The image you want is squeaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\\n    Remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point,\\n    and Security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent.\\n    Keep your nose clean.\\n\\n    Get a pilot\\'s license and make flying your number one hobby;\\n    experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non-pilot jobs.\\n\\n    Work for NASA; of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988,\\n    43 were military or NASA employees, and the remaining two were\\n    a NASA consultant and Mae Jemison (the first black female astronaut).\\n    If you apply from outside NASA and miss, but they offer you a job\\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***; sometimes in the past this has meant \"you\\n    do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first\".\\n\\n    Think space:  they want highly motivated people, so lose no chance\\n    to demonstrate motivation.\\n\\n    Keep trying.  Many astronauts didn\\'t make it the first time.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n    NASA\\n    National Aeronautics and Space Administration\\n    Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center\\n    Houston, Texas\\n\\n    Announcement for Mission Specialist and Pilot Astronaut Candidates\\n    ==================================================================\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ---------------------------\\n\\n    The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) has a need for\\n    Pilot Astronaut Candidates and Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidates\\n    to support the Space Shuttle Program. NASA is now accepting on a\\n    continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed.\\n\\n    Persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be\\n    considered.\\n\\n    All positions are located at the Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in\\n    Houston, Texas, and will involved a 1-year training and evaluation\\n    program.\\n\\n    Space Shuttle Program Description\\n    ---------------------------------\\n\\n    The numerous successful flights of the Space Shuttle have demonstrated\\n    that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming\\n    routine. The Space Shuttle Orbiter is launched into, and maneuvers in\\n    the Earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days. It then\\n    returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and\\n    flight crew.\\n\\n    The Orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment\\n    and retrieval of satellites, service of existing satellites, operation\\n    of specialized laboratories (astronomy, earth sciences, materials\\n    processing, manufacturing), and other operations. These missions will\\n    eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space\\n    station. The Orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher\\n    orbits than can be achieved by the Orbiter itself. Users of the Space\\n    Shuttle\\'s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include\\n    government agencies and private industries.\\n\\n    The crew normally consists of five people - the commander, the pilot,\\n    and three mission specialists. On occasion additional crew members are\\n    assigned. The commander, pilot, and mission specialists are NASA\\n    astronauts.\\n\\n    Pilot Astronaut\\n\\n    Pilot astronauts server as both Space Shuttle commanders and pilots.\\n    During flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle,\\n    crew, mission success and safety in flight. The pilot assists the\\n    commander in controlling and operating the vehicle. In addition, the\\n    pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing\\n    the remote manipulator system, in extra-vehicular activities, and other\\n    payload operations.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut\\n\\n    Mission specialist astronauts, working with the commander and pilot,\\n    have overall responsibility for the coordination of Shuttle operations\\n    in the areas of crew activity planning, consumables usage, and\\n    experiment and payload operations. Mission specialists are required to\\n    have a detailed knowledge of Shuttle systems, as well as detailed\\n    knowledge of the operational characteristics, mission requirements and\\n    objectives, and supporting systems and equipment for each of the\\n    experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions. Mission\\n    specialists will perform extra-vehicular activities, payload handling\\n    using the remote manipulator system, and perform or assist in specific\\n    experimental operations.\\n\\n    Astronaut Candidate Program\\n    ===========================\\n\\n    Basic Qualification Requirements\\n    --------------------------------\\n\\n    Applicants MUST meet the following minimum requirements prior to\\n    submitting an application.\\n\\n    Mission Specialist Astronaut Candidate:\\n\\n    1. Bachelor\\'s degree from an accredited institution in engineering,\\n    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be\\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable and may be\\n    substituted for part or all of the experience requirement (master\\'s\\n    degree = 1 year, doctoral degree = 3 years). Quality of academic\\n    preparation is important.\\n\\n    2. Ability to pass a NASA class II space physical, which is similar to a\\n    civilian or military class II flight physical and includes the following\\n    specific standards:\\n\\n\\t Distant visual acuity:\\n\\t      20/150 or better uncorrected,\\n\\t      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\\n\\n\\t Blood pressure:\\n\\t      140/90 measured in sitting position.\\n\\n    3.

Bachelor\\'s degree from an accredited institution in engineering,\\n    biological science, physical science or mathematics. Degree must be\\n    followed by at least three years of related progressively responsible,\\n    professional experience. An advanced degree is desirable. Quality of\\n    academic preparation is important.\\n\\n    2. At least 1000 hours pilot-in-command time in jet aircraft. Flight\\n    test experience highly desirable.\\n\\n    3. Ability to pass a NASA Class I space physical which is similar to a\\n    military or civilian Class I flight physical and includes the following\\n    specific standards:\\n\\n\\t Distant visual acuity:\\n\\t      20/50 or better uncorrected\\n\\t      correctable to 20/20, each eye.\\n\\n\\t Blood pressure:\\n\\t      140/90 measured in sitting position.\\n\\n    4. Height between 64 and 76 inches.\\n\\n    Citizenship Requirements\\n\\n    Applications for the Astronaut Candidate Program must be citizens of\\n    the United States.\\n\\n    Note on Academic Requirements\\n\\n    Applicants for the Astronaut Candidate Program must meet the basic\\n    education requirements for NASA engineering and scientific positions --\\n    specifically: successful completion of standard professional curriculum\\n    in an accredited college or university leading to at least a bachelor\\'s\\n    degree with major study in an appropriate field of engineering,\\n    biological science, physical science, or mathematics.\\n\\n      The following degree fields, while related to engineering and the\\n    sciences, are not considered qualifying:\\n      - Degrees in technology (Engineering Technology, Aviation Technology,\\n\\tMedical Technology, etc.)\\n      - Degrees in Psychology (except for Clinical Psychology, Physiological\\n\\tPsychology, or Experimental Psychology which are qualifying).\\n      - Degrees in Nursing.\\n      - Degrees in social sciences (Geography, Anthropology, Archaeology, etc.)\\n      - Degrees in Aviation, Aviation Management or similar fields.\\n\\n    Application Procedures\\n    ----------------------\\n\\n    Civilian\\n\\n    The application package may be obtained by writing to:\\n\\n\\tNASA Johnson Space Center\\n\\tAstronaut Selection Office\\n\\tATTN: AHX\\n\\tHouston, TX 77058\\n\\n    Civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis. When NASA\\n    decides to select additional astronaut candidates, consideration will be\\n    given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is\\n    made. Applications received after that date will be retained and\\n    considered for the next selection. Applicants will be notified annually\\n    of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate\\n    continued interest in being considered for the program. Those applicants\\n    who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from\\n    consideration, and their applications will not be retained. After the\\n    preliminary screening of applications, additional information may be\\n    requested for some applicants, and person listed on the application as\\n    supervisors and references may be contacted.\\n\\n    Active Duty Military\\n\\n    Active duty military personnel must submit applications to their\\n    respective military service and not directly to NASA. Application\\n    procedures will be disseminated by each service.\\n\\n    Selection\\n    ---------\\n\\n    Personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required\\n    for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration.\\n    Once final selections have been made, all applicants who were considered\\n    will be notified of the outcome of the process.\\n\\n    Selection rosters established through this process may be used for the\\n    selection of additional candidates during a one year period following\\n    their establishment.\\n\\n    General Program Requirements\\n\\n    Selected applicants will be designated Astronaut Candidates and will be\\n    assigned to the Astronaut Office at the Johnson Space Center, Houston,\\n    Texas. The astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or\\n    scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to\\n    ongoing programs. They will also participate in the basic astronaut\\n    training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills\\n    required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight. Pilot\\n    astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in NASA aircraft during\\n    their candidate period.\\n\\n    Applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does\\n    not insure selection as an astronaut. Final selection as an astronaut\\n    will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and\\n    evaluation period. Civilian candidates who successfully complete the\\n    training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become\\n    permanent Federal employees and will be expected to remain with NASA for\\n    a period of at least five years. Civilian candidates who are not\\n    selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within NASA\\n    depending upon Agency requirements and manpower constraints at that\\n    time. Successful military candidates will be detailed to NASA for a\\n    specified tour of duty.\\n\\n    NASA has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified\\n    minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates.\\n    Therefore, qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply.\\n\\n    Pay and Benefits\\n    ----------------\\n\\n    Civilians\\n\\n    Salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the Federal\\n    Governments General Schedule pay scales for grades GS-11 through GS-14,\\n    and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements\\n    and experience.\\n\\n    Other benefits include vacation and sick leave, a retirement plan, and\\n    participation in group health and life insurance plans.\\n\\n    Military\\n\\n    Selected military personnel will be detailed to the Johnson Space Center\\n    but will remain in an active duty status for pay, benefits, leave, and\\n    other similar military matters.\\n\\n\\nNEXT: FAQ #15/15 - Orbital and Planetary Launch Services\\n',\n",

The tint is rather\\nweak, and you can clearly see the inside of the car through the tint.\\n\\nThe inspection garage said that they won\\'t pass it unless I get a\\nwaiver from the state police. So I went to the state police - the\\nofficer told me that aftermarket tint is illegal, and I can get a\\nwaiver only for a pre-84 car or for a medical reason. I asked him to\\nshow me the section of the vehicle code that says it\\'s illegal.  He\\nshowed it to me and the paraghaph said that you can\\'t have tint, if\\nyou can\\'t see the inside of the car because of the tint. When I told\\nhim that you can in fact see the inside very well, he shut the book\\nand said \"It\\'s just illegal, and in fact we can have someone give you\\na ticket for it right now.\" Well, won\\'t argue with that...\\n\\nSince the vehicle code says it\\'s OK as long as you can see through the\\ntint, I\\'d like to keep it (I\\'ll re-read the vehicle code in the\\nlibrary).  I\\'d also like to get some sort of paper from the police\\nthat says it\\'s OK, so I can get the inspection, and so that I won\\'t\\nget in trouble for the tint later on. I also wouldn\\'t mind registering\\na complaint against that officer - he really pissed me off.\\n\\nSo does anyone have any experience getting that sort of a paper from\\nthe police, especially in Pennsylvania? Does anyone have any experience\\nregistering a complaint against an officer? I called the station \\nlater on today, but they basically said there is no place where I\\ncould register a complaint against an officer... And if I do decide\\nto keep the tint and get a ticket anyway, how much of a chance do\\nI stand to succesfully appeal the ticket in court?\\n\\nAny comments about it will be welcome!\\n\\nMichal\\n\\n',\n",

              "       b'Date: Wed, 21 Apr 1993 22:54:35 GMT\\nLines: 120\\n\\n   As promised, I spoke today with the company mentioned in a Washington\\nTimes article about the Clipper chip announcement. The name of the company\\nis Secure Communicatiions Technology (Information will be given at the end\\nof this message on how to contact them).\\n\\n   Basically they are disturbed about the announcement for many reasons that\\nwe are. More specifically however, Mr. Bryen of Secure Communications\\nbrought to light many points that might interest most of the readers.\\n\\n   His belief is that AT&T was made known of the clipper well before the\\nrest of the industry. This is for several reasons, several of which are:\\n\\n - A company of AT&T\\'s size could never be able to make a decision to use\\n   the new chip on the SAME DAY it was announced.\\n\\n - Months ago they proposed using their own chip for AT&T\\'s secure telephone\\n   devices. AT&T basically blew them off as being not interested at all.\\n   This stuck them as strange, until now...\\n\\n\\n   Also I spoke with Art Melnick, their cryptographer, he expressed several\\nconcerns over the new Clipper Chip:\\n\\n  - The obvious backdoor will be able to let many people decrypt the code.\\n\\n  - Once the key is released to authorities the security of the crypto\\n    system is lost forever. These keys can end up in the hands of any agency\\n    of the government.\\n\\n  - The fact that the escrowed keys never change means that the algorithm\\n    is vulnerable over time to an attacker.\\n\\n  - The classified algorithm may hide another backdoor. But he feels that\\n    it is probably to keep people from forging fake serial numbers, or\\n    changing the keys themselves.\\n\\n  - Additionally he feels that the NSA has probably spent enough time and\\n    money in working on a way to keep this chip from being reversed\\n    engineered, that he feels that reverse engineering it will be very\\n    difficult to do. He feels that they have developed a suitable technique\\n    to protect the chip from this attack. Also he feels that the chip is\\n    hardware encoded with the algorithm and not microcoded onto the chip.\\n\\nAdditonally I spoke with Mr. Melnick about their algorithm. He couldn\\'t tell\\nme much about their new agorithm because it hasn\\'t been patented yet.\\nHowever he told me a little:\\n\\n - The algorithm will be released for public review after patents have been\\n   granted for it. This is so the crypto community can see that it is\\n   secure.\\n\\n - The algorithm is called NEA for New Encryption Algorithm.\\n   The details were sketchy because now it is held as a trade secret\\n   until the patent was issued, but I was told that it will incorporate\\n   the following:\\n\\n    - It will have fast encryption of data (Exact specs not given, but\\n      Mr. Melnick stated \"Much faster than what an RS-232 can put out.\")\\n\\n    - It is a symmetric cipher, just like IDEA and DES.\\n\\n    - It will use 64 bit data blocks for encryption (like DES and IDEA).\\n\\n    - The key length was not given to me, but Mr. Melnick states that\\n      it is _adujustable_ and is \"More than adequate for security.\"\\n\\n    - The algorithm is written in C and Assembler in software form, and\\n      can be ported to many platforms (Unlike the the Clipper Chip which\\n      is hardware ONLY and cannot be made into software) This I\\n      consider a definite plus for the NEA for widespread use.\\n\\n    - The algorithm will accomodate public key distribution techniques\\n      such as RSA or Diffie-Hellman. This will also be supported in the\\n      hardware chip.\\n\\n    - Right now the projected cost of the NEA chip will be about 10 dollars\\n      for each!! (Clipper will run 25 each chip [that is if it is produced\\n      enough, which probably won\\'t happen]).\\n\\n    - They currently sell a program called C-COM that uses the algorithm\\n      and a special streaming protocol that does not divide the encrypted\\n      data into \"blocks.\" This could prevent plaintext attacks if you know\\n      what the block header is. This program operates at all supported\\n      RS-232 speeds and uses the software implementation of the algorithm.\\n\\n    - Most importantly: IT DOES NOT HAVE A BACKDOOR!!\\n\\n\\n\\nRight now the company is afraid that the new clipper chip will put them out\\nof business. This is a very real possibility. So they really need help in\\nstopping the clipper chip from becoming a standard.
